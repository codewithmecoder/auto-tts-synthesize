Every noise of the store intensified. Paxine knew she was hearing through Tache’s ears. Running feet. Two sets. She stooped into a rack, behind the clothes. Tache crouched beside her, his eyes following the feet as they passed, then he dashed out, heading the opposite direction.

“Hey,” a man’s voice said, shouting.

Tache dove into another rack of clothes. Paxine tucked herself in beside him.

Running feet passed again, then stopped. Tache stared in their direction, not moving a muscle, not even his tail.

“Watch the racks,” the man’s voice said in a whisper so close to Paxine that she almost jumped. “There’s one moving. Over there.”

“Ahhh.”

Tache dashed out. Paxine following, checking behind to see an old lady screaming two racks away. The man must have jumped her while she looked through clothes on the rack, thinking it was Paxine.

So much was going on in the store, but Paxine was afraid to look over the racks to see if she could find her mom. Hold on, she thought. The fitting rooms. She could hide in there. Tache whacked her hard with his tail. There wasn’t anyone around, why couldn’t she…

The woman with the slashed face stepped out of the fitting room area. She stood there as if guarding them with an angry scowl on her face.

Tache tapped her with his tail, leading her down another aisle.

“Hey,” the woman said, shouting over to her people. “Over there.”

The running feet. Paxine kept low, circling around a rack instead of dodging in it. The running feet kept on going. Tache dodged across another isle. There was a counter. More racks. And quiet.

Tache and Paxine both crept into a rack. A number of different shoes passed, but no one was running. Then there was a pair of shoes Paxine recognized. She poked Tache, pointing at the shoes walking by. Paxine slipped out of the rack, standing up beside her mom, sliding her hand into her mom’s hand.

Her mom tightened her grip, giving no other reaction to Paxine’s sudden reappearance. They both stood there watching the disarray of the store, as if they had always been standing there together.

Paxine lowered her backpack for Tache, hoisting him up and following her mom toward the checkouts. Her mom guided them away from the people running around, keeping Paxine on the far side of her, away from the turmoil.

“What are they doing?” a clerk said.

“Lost kid probably,” another clerk said back to her.

Both clerks seemed mesmerized by the commotion, ignoring their customers.

“Can we check out?” her mom said.

Paxine couldn’t believe her mom wanted to check out. Shouldn’t they be escaping out of the store?

“Ah, sure. Find everything?” the clerk said.

“Can I get a gift certificate here?” her mom said.

How could her mom be so calm? Didn’t she realize people were trying to get her daughter?

“Sure,” the clerk said, digging in a drawer.

How could her mom… Paxine’s heart was racing… No one paid them any attention. Her mom and she were invisible to the people racing around the store because they were acting like normal customers. They weren’t drawing attention to themselves. How did her mom know this?

“Thank you. Come again,” the clerk said, shifting her attention back to the turmoil in the store.

Paxine expected them to hurry out of the store, but her mom just moved away from the checkout counter, looking back. Then, to Paxine’s surprise, her mom raised her hand as if to get a teacher’s attention. What was her mom thinking?

Her mom dropped her hand. There was Dwayne, walking fast toward them. He looked much relieved to see them. Together they left the store.

“What happened?” her mom said as soon as the cube door closed, holding tight to Paxine’s hand.

“Someone pushed a cart into me and I tripped and fell. By the time I got up, you were both gone. I searched and finally saw you,” Dwayne said, motioning toward her mom, “but I couldn’t see Paxine. I saw people running and I assumed they were chasing her. I kept getting fouled by carts. There had to be at least six people involved. There was one lady with scratch marks on her cheeks.” His gaze turned to Paxine as if she should now tell her story, but she said nothing. She wasn’t going to tell her side of the story to him.

The cube dinged, and the escort stepped out. They were back at her dad’s office.

“Be sure to make your report,” her mom said, and then she closed the door on his surprised face. Her mom slipped out her phone as soon as the cube moved again.

“Hi Greta, this is Dalia,” her mom said. There was a short pause. “Mom. Can you meet us for lunch?”

Paxine could hear her grandma’s voice through the phone.

“Yes. By the sounds of your breathing, I better. Meet me at the Roof Top,” her grandma said.

The Roof Top was a restaurant appropriately named since it was at the top of a building. It was one of her grandma’s favorites. The roof overhead was glass, and the sun streamed in. There were flowering plants and full size trees. It was a year round garden.

At their table, her grandma pulled a chair around to face the sun for Tinder. Paxine copied her. Both cats hopped up into their respective chairs and sprawled out to nap.

Paxine and her mom updated her grandma on the events at the store. Her grandma kept staring at Tache.

“He’s still in training,” her grandma said, sounding concerned. “You’re not supposed to over exert your Tail.”

Paxine opened her mouth to explain, but her grandma stopped her. “It appears we haven’t told Tache this. He is doing exceedingly well,” her grandma said with praise, letting Paxine know she had done nothing wrong.

“Mom,” her mom said, “if I could have had a heart attack, I would. That was absolutely terrifying.”

Her grandma nodded with understanding while she continued to stare at Tache.

“Should Doug know about…” her mom said.

Her grandma shook her head. “He’ll know about what happened from his own man’s report. I’m not going to share my investigation. I have my own misgivings about his security.”

Her mom sighed, nibbling absentmindedly on a bread stick. “What else can we do?”

“I can’t change Doug’s security. I can only add to it. Tache is doing his job. I have her nanny coming, but getting her here takes time,” her grandma said.

“Ladies?” the waitress handed out menus, but Paxine’s grandma held up a hand to stop her.

“Ice tea all around and chicken crepes,” her grandma said.

“Sounds good. Thank you, ladies,” the waitress said, rushing off.

Paxine thought about complaining about not being able to order except she always had the chicken crepes when she came here. Although she would have gotten a soda, but knew because her mom was here, that was out of the question.

“But there must be something we can do,” her mom said, breaking a long period of silence.

“I want you to stay at my house until you can secure another,” her grandma said.

“Here you go ladies.” The waitress set down their ice teas and another came in with their plates.

Paxine’s mom ate very little, but Paxine and her grandma ate half of their plates.

Her grandma pushed aside her plate. “You did say you found a new house?”

“Yes. It’s not as nice as the last one. It’s almost like a holiday cottage; small, comfortable and quiet. Actually, before I forget, I should let Doug know about it and see if it meets approval,” her mom said, tapping away on her phone.

Then her mom voiced her true concern, “They’re after Paxine. Not Doug. Not me.”

Her mom and grandma locked eyes.

“We’re fighting against our own security, aren’t we? Doug’s people are clueless to what is going on. They can’t protect us. I mean, if it wasn’t for Tache…” her mom said, almost crying, but she took a deep breath, pulling herself together.

“Yes,” her grandma said. “I need to step up my training with Paxine.”

Her mom’s words made Paxine feel small and defenseless, battling against the whole world. Maybe she needed a couple more Tails.

The clouds broke when the moving van pulled into the driveway. A whole week of rain left the air fresh and clean. There was more rain in the forecast, but her mom hoped it would stay off until they finished moving into the new house.

The moving van blocked the front door, so Paxine escaped out the back. The backyard grass was wet, but the sun was out and things were drying. Tache walked with care through the grass unsure if he liked wet grass or not. Every flick of his tail sent water flying.

Whack.

His tail hit her with a solid thud.

“Hey, that hurts. You’re getting me wet,” she said, moving away.

He flicked his tail at her, hopping closer.

“Hey, stay away,” she said, veering off toward the ditch. It was full of water.

Whack.

“Tache,” she said, complaining.

She ran off to the other side of the yard, toward the gate flapping in the breeze. She caught it, holding it open. The trees in the next lot seemed larger when viewed from the gate rather than up on the porch. In fact, some of them looked climbable. Over by a brush pile, she thought there was a ladder that went up into a tree house. She added it to her list of things to check out once security loosened up. If it ever loosened up.

On the porch, watching her, was a new security escort, and he was nervous with every step she took. She knew she couldn’t go through the gate.

So far, the neighborhood was empty. Not even a nosey neighbor appeared when the moving truck pulled up. She wondered if anybody lived in the other houses. Maybe later, during dinnertime, she might see people come home, but only if they used cars. If they all had personal cubes, she would never see them unless they came out into the yard.

“Paxine.” Her mom was standing on the porch.

She heard the moving van drive down the street and knew it was time to unpack.

“Bug check,” the security escort said, scanning her and Tache for any mechanical bugs and did a physical check for real ones before he let them back into the house.

The house smelled of fresh paint and the walls weren’t white any more.

“Move anything with a “P” written on it up to your room,” her mom said from the kitchen where the walls were now lilac.

“What if it looks like a “d”?” she said, staring at the huge pile of boxes in the living room. The walls were now painted peach.

“Then the box is upside down,” her mom said, grabbing a box marked kitchen.

Tache jumped onto a box marked “P”.

“Good thing there isn’t a room in this house also starting with a “P”,” she said, grabbing the box and heading upstairs. “Good thing no boxes go to the porch. That’s the only thing I can think of that starts with “P”.”

She dumped the box into her room, now painted pale green. Her bed was already setup, but there weren’t any sheets. She knew she would be searching through boxes for them by the end of the day.

“Yelp,” Tache said, heading toward the door.

“Okay, I know. A thousand more boxes to go.” She raced him down the stairs.

Whack.

Tache’s tail hit a box marked with a “P”.

“Thanks, Tache. Is there another? I can carry two.”

With Tache’s help, she moved all the boxes she could find, knowing her mom would find some she missed. There was little room left to maneuver in her room. She cut through the tape, empting each box. Her drawers were soon full and she had a cave of boxes made for Tache.

“How’s moving day?” her grandma said, opening the bedroom door.

“Grandma. You here to help?”

“For a few hours. I have some homework for you,” her grandma took out a bundle of papers.

Paxine groaned.

“No, some of my homework,” her grandma said.

“Oh?” she said, knowing grandma homework was always more fun.

Her grandma folded the papers, but instead of handing them to her, slipped the bundle into her backpack. “This is for when you can have some quiet time alone. I would like you to read it and see what you can understand. For your eyes only,” her grandma said in a quiet voice, then she dropped the backpack on the floor.

“Hey, mom. Come to help?,” her mom said, poking her head around the door. “Doing good, Paxine. The boxes, once someone is done playing with them, can go into the garage.”

They didn’t own a car, so the garage was storage.

Tache dove into the tower of boxes, knocking them down.

“Yes, mom,” She pretended to be annoyed, but Tache was so funny, she ended up laughing.

“I’ll hang these up,” her mom said, grabbing a coat and the backpack. “Hey, mom, you’re just in time to help with the china.”

Her grandma and mom laughed, and Paxine rolled her eyes. That was supposed to be a joke. Her grandma liked to break china, or at least that’s what her mom told her. Paxine had never seen her grandma break anything.

Over the next couple of days, everyone was busy unpacking. Even her dad stayed home one day, and spent less time at the office on the other days. Since security was still tight, she didn’t go to school, although homework continued to arrive. Even with unpacking and homework, the house was dull and boring. She was supposed to spend more time with her grandma, and she had, but since the move, she had been stuck in the new house. It was raining again, so going outside wasn’t an option.

“I need a Room,” Paxine said with a groan, following her mom. Her mom ignored her while she hung up curtains in the living room. “Can’t I go to dad’s office?”

“He’s really busy,” her mom said.

“I just need The Room,” she said, trying to sound pitiful.

Her mom rolled her eyes. “I brought you some new books to read.”

“Paper books. I can’t even enjoy an e-book.” She drooped her shoulders and trying to look as dejected as possible.

“You poor, poor dear,” her mom said, not sounding sympathetic as she straightened the curtain and left the room.

Paxine plopped down on the sofa, bouncing Tache who was sleeping. He didn’t wake, having spent all night patrolling the house. She sighed, curling up next to him.

A crack of thunder shook the house, waking Tache. Rain fell in sheets so thick it was impossible to see out of the windows.

“We’re gonna need a boat pretty soon Tache. Do you have a raincoat? Do you even know how to swim?” She wondered if the ditch in the backyard was full and if she could use it as a swimming pool.

Tache ignored her, trying to go back to sleep. The windows lit up with a flash of lightening and a boom shook the house. His ears twitched as he focused toward the back of the house. He rose, heading toward the backdoor. She followed.

The coat closet beside the backdoor was open, where her mom had been storing coats and hats. Tache ducked inside.

“We have…” she started to said, but then shut up instantly at his mental urging. She dropped on all fours, squeezing in beside him, then pulling the door almost closed, so there was a thin gap through which to peak.

She felt odd hiding. There was more thunder, muffled now that they were in the closet. She shifted to get more comfortable, fumbling on some rubber boots. They were hers. She slipped them on. Over her head, she pulled down her raincoat, only to freeze when the hangers clinked. Tache glared at her, whacking her with his tail.

“Sorry”, she mouthed, slipping on the coat as quiet as possible, but the coat rustled with her every move.

Boom. More thunder. The flashes of lightening couldn’t reach them in the closet. Rain beat on the porch roof. She wondered if that was all Tache heard, but he was still alert, staring through the closet wall, as if he had x-ray vision, toward the back porch.

His right ear flicked. Footsteps. One, no two people. They had to be security guards, she thought. Her heart pounded against her chest. She couldn’t remember if there were two security guards in the back. Wasn’t there one up front and one in the back?

The backdoor knob turned and cool wet air wafted down the hallway. Two men passed. They weren’t security guards. Tap. Tache’s tail touched her hand, sending a jolt through her. He pushed the door open wider. On the opposite wall was a deactivator. The normal indicator light was off. The electricity to the whole house was off.

Tache reached up, tapping the door handle. His message was clear; it was time to get out of there. Paxine knew her mom had her phone and the cube. All she had was Tache. She hoped her mom would be okay.

Up on a hook by the door was her backpack where her mom had hung it up out of the way. Paxine grabbed the backpack, following Tache out the back door. She didn’t worry about being quiet when shutting the door. The rain pounded the roof, drowning out any other sound.

Paxine hoisted her coat up over her head, running toward the gate, which was flapping wildly in the wind. She and Tache timed the flaps, slipping through unscathed, keeping the gate between them and the house.

Tache led the way, heading toward the tree house ladder. He looked as if he was going to climb the ladder, but he only rubbed his muddy feet on the first couple of rungs. His fur stuck against his body and mud coated his legs and belly. Paxine was glad for her rubber boots.

She was also glad Tache didn’t intend to climb up into the tree house. The ladder wobbled, not looking too strong. She wiped her own muddy boots on the first two ladder rungs, knowing what he was thinking. Anyone following them would see the mud, thinking they were up in the tree house, and have to climb the whole way to make sure.

Tache trotted off, keeping to grassy areas as much as possible. Paxine took the same path as Tache, making sure she left few footprints. There was little need to worry since the rain washed away their trail as fast as they passed.

The road that ran behind her house curved, meeting up with them. She was surprised to see a car parked right behind their house. How could someone park there and their guards not notice? Where were their guards?

She shuddered at a mental image from Tache. He knew where their security guards were and that was why he avoided the ditch. He could smell them floating there.

Paxine clutched her raincoat, following Tache as he ducked back into the woods until the car was out of sight. He crossed the road, leading her through yards, avoiding the roads.

The quiet neighborhoods became city streets, loud with traffic noises. She had no idea where they were going. The people she did see hardly took notice of her following a cat. It was raining so hard that everyone was in a hurry to get out of the rain.

Tache turned down an alley where one side of a roof hung over, keeping it dry. He shook, sending water flying. There was no more mud on him, but he was drenched, looking miserable. She used her hand like a squeegee, wiping as much water off him as she could.

She needed something to dry him. The alley was full of trash bags. She swung off her backpack, grabbing her Swiss Army knife out of a side pocket.

“Thanks, Alice,” Paxine said as if Alice was there.

Paxine sliced through the bags until she found some clean dry paper. She blotted his fur, but the paper didn’t soak up much water.

She used a bag of trash as a chair, while she searched through her backpack. There was a bunch of papers and a yellow and blue striped sock. So, that’s where that sock went. Her mom hadn’t thrown it away after all. She laughed to herself about wearing that pair of socks again. Her mom hated those socks.

The sock absorbed water better and in no time, she had soaked up all the water that she could off of Tache.

“You’re on your own,” she said, startled by her voice. Her voice seemed loud even though she whispered. They were alone in the alley and few people passed. She felt a little scared.

Paxine sorted through the papers in her backpack for something to do. The papers were the homework from her grandma. Someone hurried past the alley. She half expected it to be her grandma, but it wasn’t. Her pinky ring was hard to see on her hand, but it gave her some comfort. Her grandma would be able to find her. She wasn’t lost, just waiting.

She smoothed out the papers. The clouds were so dark that the streetlight at the end of the alley was on, creating just enough light to read by.

The document heading was in big bold letters: The Child Protection Act.

Groan.

This wasn’t going to be as exciting as she expected. The document, peppered with legal terminology, was boring and didn’t always make sense. No wonder her dad got so frustrated with his job.

Page four…This was what upset her grandma so much. Her dad probably wouldn’t like it either. She didn’t even like it and how could someone think that the government should have this power. ‘Selective parentage…the government’s obligation to protect…’

She scanned through the rest of the document, but only that one paragraph stood out as inappropriate. Although as far as she was concerned, the whole document was unnecessary. Sometime adults could be so stupid.

Paxine stroked Tache’s fur, finding he was almost dry. He was curled up in a tight ball in her lap, sleeping. She wondered if Tinder would get wet when her grandma came. No one passed by the alley for some time now.

There were twelve more sheets of paper left, and each one seemed to be about a particular person. They proved to be much more interesting reading and there were pictures.

Mr. Huntsboro. She remembered him from the newscast. There was a paragraph about his parents and his grandparents. The next one was about someone she didn’t know. There again, was a paragraph about his parents and his grandparents.

The third page was about Judge Sampling. She knew him. Then she realized what the paragraphs about their families meant. They were from underprivileged or poor families. Judge Sampling had worked his way through college the hard way. He didn’t have rich well-to-do parents to pave his way. It was the same for each person listed.

Paxine shifted on the garbage bag, her butt hurt. The garbage bag didn’t seem so soft any more. Where was her grandma? Was her mom okay? Everyone must realize she was missing by now. She leaned over Tache, putting her cheek on his head. He was warm and dry, and comforting, but her butt still hurt.

There was nothing else to do but re-read the papers, and then put them away. Her grandma had to come soon. The rain eased up, but the darkness didn’t as evening set in. Tache woke and stretched.

“Well, what do we do now? We don’t even know where we are,” she said in a quiet voice.

Tache pawed at his nearly invisible Aural ring.

“Garon’s? I don’t know where that is. We always traveled by cube. Now, if I had a cube…” she said.

Tache wrinkled his nose.

“You can smell him? So what are you now a blood hound?” she said, sniffing. “All I smell is wet garbage and cars.”

Tache pawed at the backpack, wanting to get inside. Paxine put the papers in another pocket and then let Tache hop inside. She hoisted up the backpack, putting it on so he was in front, like when they had been with her grandma smelling soap. His head and swiveling ears were all that was visible.

The street at the end of the alley was empty. Streetlights glared off the puddles. The rain had stopped altogether and it was eerily quiet. She felt as if this was not the place for her to be even with a Tail to protect her.

Tache leaned forward in the direction he wanted to go. Not a single person or car in sight. He leaned to turn her up a street, toward a busy thoroughfare. Cars whizzed by. Still no people walking. She felt uncomfortable, but Tache didn’t seem concerned, his ears acting like mini antennas, twitching in all directions.

He directed her back onto a quiet street. Lights leaked around curtains, but the street was empty. He leaned to direct her down an alley. She stopped in her tracks. The alley was black like a hole.

“Too scary. I’m not going down there. I can’t see a thing,” she said in a whisper.

The alley came into view as if a light switched on. There were trash bins lined neatly against one wall and a door with a broken overhead light half way down. Tache was showing her the alley through his eyes.

He bumped her to stop before she reached the end. There was one car parked by a broken street light. A man got out, heading for the building nearest her. She backed up before Tache bumped her, hoping the man hadn’t seen her. There were footsteps up the stairs and a door opened and closed.

Tache’s ears flew back, causing Paxine to spin. The door halfway down the alley opened behind them, spilling a sliver of light. An older man exited the building, hurrying down the alley.

Garon.

His name was on the tip of her tongue.

Bump.

She almost bit her tongue when Tache hit against her. He didn’t need to give her any more prompting. She knew she had to follow Garon. However, at the end of the alley, Garon was nowhere in sight.

Tache leaned to the left.

How could Garon be out of sight already, she thought, breaking into a run.

Bump. Bump.

She felt as if something was jarring her whole body.

Tache.

Bump.

Tache slipped in the backpack, unable to keep his footing from her movement. She slowed to a fast walk so not to bump him around so much.

Tache directed her across the street, into another alley. She felt more like she was being chased rather than the other way around. The backpack felt heavy and she was getting tired. She had no idea where she was, dodging in and out of streets and alleys. Her only comfort was that Tache seemed to know where they were going.

Paxine caught her breath, waiting for a light to change at a busy intersection. Where was Garon? Could he really move that fast? She crossed the street, turning into an alley half way down.

There was Garon, waiting for her by a door. He put a finger to his lips to keep quiet, ushering her inside. The door closed without a sound behind them. Paxine couldn’t believe how fast he could move, climbing the stairs ahead of her.

His breathing was as heavy as hers when he stopped at a plain door on the fourth floor. Apartment four zero seven. The numbers were faded. He was careful when he inserted a key as if the door would bite him if he wasn’t careful. The door opened without a sound. He guided her in with a hand before being just as careful closing the door.

Paxine backed into a table, grabbing it to keep herself from falling. There was nothing on the table, so she turn around, letting her backpack slide down with relief. Tache hopped out.

“My. My,” Garon said, stepping up to Tache. “You are a smart one.” He scratched Tache’s head, then gave him a gentle head butt that Tache reciprocated. Garon stood there as if he could pet Tache all night. “Goodness. He is a good kitty.” Garon laughed.

Paxine didn’t know what to say. A million questions zoomed through her head while Garon stood there petting Tache. She could feel her lips move as if she was trying to ask those million questions, but none of them came out.

“Your mom is fine,” Garon said as if sensing her questions, “but she doesn’t know you’re safe yet. Goodness, things are getting tricky.” He stopped petting Tache to fill a kettle with water, putting it on the stove.

“This place is a little old fashioned; you’ll have to excuse me. Sit down, sit down. We will be here for a bit until the all clear. Did you get wet in that rain? Here let me put the heater on,” Garon said, turning a knob on a box on the floor. In moments, the box glowed red, radiating heat.

Paxine shivered, not sure if she was cold or just relieved to find Garon. The water was boiling in the kettle before she took off her coat and boots, settling on the torn sofa with Tache on her lap. He was warm.

Garon handed her a cup of tea. The scent of tea with sugar and milk drifted up to her. Tache tapped his tail with his approval of the tea even before she thought of it. The tea was delicious, warming her. She drained the cup, setting it on the floor.

Garon continued to rummage through the kitchen, setting down a bowl. Tache jumped over to it, crunching as fast as he could. There was already a water bowl. Her lap felt cold without him.

“Thank you,” she said, remembering her manners.

Garon smiled with a nod, turning to his own tea. She leaned back on the sofa, but never saw him drink.

Big yellow eyes. Paxine woke with a start. Her hand found Tache curled up beside her, sleeping. Big yellow eyes? Two big yellow eyes stared at her from the end of the sofa where a full-grown cat sat. Grayish in color. Tinder? Her movement to check for her grandma caused the cat’s eyes to open even wider and the head to turn as if it was thinking of fleeing. This wasn’t Tinder. This cat was brown spotted like Tache but more faded which made the cat look gray at first.

Garon sat in the kitchen tinkering with something on the table. The apartment was so quiet she didn’t want to disturb the peace.

She spoke in a whisper, “Who’s that?”

“Shaloonya,” Garon said in a normal voice. “The naughty child.”

“Who?”

“Shaloonya, my Tail,” Garon said with a grin, but he didn’t look up from the table.

She reached out a hand to Shaloonya, but Shaloonya leaned away as if terrified that she was going to be touched. Tache whacked her with his tail. He wanted to sleep. He ignored Shaloonya as if she wasn’t even there.

Paxine felt she was still dreaming. How could Garon have a Tail? Only she and her grandma had Tails. Yes, she had to be dreaming. Besides, he hadn’t a Tail when she and her grandma visited his shop.

Rap. Rap.

A quiet knock on the door.

Garon rose, unlocking and opening the door as quiet as before.

“Grandma,” Paxine said, bolting upright. Tache rolled into her warm spot. Shaloonya dashed behind the sofa.

“Garon taking good care of you?” her grandma said, giving Paxine a hug and Tache a quick pet before joining Garon at the table.

Paxine nodded, not knowing what to say. Her grandma and Garon sat there without a word, staring at each other. Shaloonya appeared from behind the sofa, approaching her grandma’s handbag. Tinder popped her head out and the two sniffed noses, then Tinder disappeared back into the handbag and Shaloonya disappeared behind the sofa.

“Paxine,” her grandma said, sounding loud in the quiet apartment. “You’ll stay with Garon for a few days. Your mom was worried sick about you but I’ve calmed her. She knew immediately something was up when the lights went out. She trusted your Tail and escaped in the cube before the men were even up the stairs. Your dad doesn’t know you’re safe yet, but soon will.”

“What time is it?” She couldn’t see a clock.

“About 3am. I want you to stay missing. So enjoy some time here. I brought your gamer. There are no deactivators here,” her grandma said, handing her the gamer. “Remember to listen to your Tail. Garon will teach you a few more things that you and Tache will enjoy.”

Her grandma rose.

“You’re leaving already?” She was expecting her grandma to stay awhile and explain what happened.

“Soon, but first, I want you to listen to a call, but I don’t want you to say a word. Okay?” Her grandma moved her chair closer to the sofa.

“Grandma?” Paxine said.

“Yes,” her grandma said, poised to dial her phone.

“I didn’t know others had cats, I mean Tails,” Paxine said, looking at Garon.

“There is a lot you need to learn. Now listen,” her grandma said.

“Hello Doug. Do you have a moment?” her grandma said into the phone.

“You do realize what time it is,” her dad said, sounding tired.

“You’re still at work,” her grandma said, setting her phone on her lap in speaker mode so everyone could hear.

“My daughter’s missing. We need to find her,” her dad said as if that explained everything.

Paxine recognized the dangerous tone of her dad’s voice. He was upset. She didn’t think he appreciated her grandma’s call in the middle of the night, thinking she was interfering.

“Have you thrown out the black mail theory?” Her grandma smiled, winking at Paxine, knowing she hadn’t been kidnapped.

“No one has contacted us or any of the staff,” her dad said. “We can’t rule out any theory.”

Paxine could almost hear the word ‘yet’ in her dad’s voice. That’s why her grandma brought it up. That’s what he and his staff suspected, but they were wrong.

“I hear she was wearing her raincoat and boots. No kidnapper would have allowed her to put on rain gear,” her grandma said, setting the stage.

“Yes, those were missing from the house,” her dad said in a flat voice. “Dalia thinks she left on her own with the cat protecting her.”

“Quite possible,” her grandma said.

“He’s a cat, not a bodyguard,” her dad said with some irritation.

“Are you sure about that?” her grandma said as if teasing.

“We are already…doing everything… we can possibly do…to find Paxine,” he said in a tired voice.

“The same security that can’t protect her is trying to find her?” Her was no longer sounding being nice.

“I can’t discuss my security with you,” her dad said.

“Oh? For fear that I can defeat it?” It was a challenging question.

“I don’t know or care what you think. My security is quite capable…”

“Of failing to protect a twelve year old girl,” her grandma said, completing his sentence.

There was silence on the other end. Had her dad gotten mad and hung up?

“You have an internal security problem. My granddaughter…” her grandma said.

“You think I’m not worried about my own daughter?” Her dad’s voice exploded out of the phone.

Paxine wished she could tell him she was okay, but her grandma kept her eye on her.

“Why has your security failed and mine hasn’t?” her grandma said, talking in a calm voice as if the whole crisis of his daughter missing was unimportant. Her grandma continued, not waiting or expecting an answer. “If it hadn’t been for my security…for the Tails….Tache specifically, you’d have a more serious situation on your hands. You have an inside problem that is too close to home. You need to really look at where everyone’s alliances are.”

“You’re questioning my security? My security? I have the whole damn government at my disposal,” her dad said in a strong voice.

“Your security handled the security at the house. Your security failed,” her grandma said matter-of-fact.

There was a long silence again. Paxine had never experienced her dad being speechless.

“I can’t see who… why…my security…” her dad said, cutting himself off as if he realized he wasn’t making sense.

“Someone has found a way around your security,” her grandma said.

“I understand the concerns for your granddaughter…” her dad said, regaining control of his voice, sounding like he was now trying to take control of the conversation.

“My concerns go beyond my granddaughter. My concerns go beyond your security. My concern is the Child Protection Act,” her grandma said.

There was again silence on the other end. Paxine sensed her dad was confused, maybe not expecting this sort of attack from her grandma. Her grandma was telling him he had a problem. She didn’t think her dad liked that.

“I heard about the beetle and I know about Rostenter. I would be very concerned if I were you. I would have your security, your offices, your staff, and everything else you can think of checked for bugs. Real bugs. Maybe you really need to fumigate your offices,” her grandma said, sounding more like she was giving orders.

“What is your connection with the Child Protection Act?” her dad said, his voice sounded dangerous again.

“Let us just say that I’m not a supporter of the Act and nor are the organizations that I represent. Personally, I’m very concerned about this act and I’m just as involved as you are. The Gala Ball is key and I will be attending,” her grandma said.

Paxine knew now her grandma hadn’t called her dad about her. Her own mind was putting together pieces to the puzzle, connecting the dots, so to speak. The Child Protection Act, the intruders in their house, and the beetle were all connected. Was her dad making the same connection?

“What I don’t know…” her grandma said, jolting everyone back to the present. “…is whether our enemy is after Paxine because of you or me.”

“What do you mean?” her dad said, not sounding tired any more.

“You are a powerful player in regards to this Act, and someone is capitalizing on it by targeting your daughter. I’m also a powerful player. Someone is targeting my granddaughter,” her grandma said.

“Yes…,” her dad said, acknowledging her grandma’s words.

“I will say this again.” Her grandma’s voice was commanding. “You need to re-evaluate your security and where their alliances are. Your security is breached and not to be trusted.”

“Yes,” her dad said, but Paxine couldn’t tell if he was acknowledging or agreeing with her grandma’s word.

“Are you getting us another cat?” her dad said.

Paxine couldn’t believe her ears. Her dad wanting another cat?

Her grandma laughed. “No. Only Paxine needs a Tail. Don’t worry about her. She has the Tachalarm, remember?”

“Yes, I remember.” He drew out the ‘Yes’ like a sigh of relief. Her dad now knew she was okay.

“I’ve already spoken with Dalia,” her grandma said.

“I’ve got to open more drawers,” her dad said, confusing Paxine until Tache whacked her with his tail, looking smug.

Her dad was talking about having to act more like Tache. She almost laughed aloud.

Her grandma gave her a look to be quiet.

“Come to my house tomorrow, I mean today, for dinner. Don’t tell your staff. I’ll introduce you to JayLee, Paxine’s new nanny,” her grandma said.

“Another security breach?” her dad said, meaning that the nanny could just be another security issue.

“No, she comes highly recommended and has her own Tail. Paxine will like her. She even speaks Portuguese,” her grandma said, giving Paxine a wink.

“Why Portuguese?” her dad said, sounding just as curious as Paxine felt.

“My housekeeper speaks Portuguese,” her grandma said as if that was the only reason. “JayLee is also well versed in your types of security and to my types of security.”

“Okay. See you tonight. Is that all?” her dad said.

“Yes, get some rest and start investigating your own staff. G’nite,” her grandma said, ending the call.

“My dad is the one with all the problems?” Paxine said, remembering her grandma had always said her dad was the one with the problem, and she thought she was just meaning with Tache.

“I think his advisor…” her grandma said.

“Kirt?” Paxine said, not feeling surprised.

“Yes, Kirt is getting behind the times. He’s a bulldog in an investigation, but he tends to miss things and he’s not up-to-date in the latest technology. That’s a government problem and your dad is trying to do the best he can with what he’s given,” her grandma said.

“I’m glad he knows I’m safe,” she said.

“I’m glad you picked up on that. Now get some sleep,” her grandma said rising.

Paxine woke to find that she was alone. Garon was no longer in the kitchen. Even Tache wasn’t by her side. That scared her. Shaloonya dashed into the room, startling her. Tache was close behind, chasing Shaloonya around the sofa.

Shaloonya lapped around the sofa again when Tache dove into her, rolling them both across the floor in a tangle of legs and tails.

Hiss.

Shaloonya separated herself, dashing back around the sofa with Tache close behind.

“Tache. No. Tache,” she said, scared.

The two cats raced around again, bumping a chair in the kitchen, which slid across the floor with a loud scrape.

“No. Tache,” She didn’t know what to do. She knew she couldn’t catch them since they were moving too fast.

A door opened and Garon, still in his pajamas, hurried out.

“Garon. Tache and Shaloonya are fighting,” she said, hoping he could catch Shaloonya.

“Oh,” Garon said with a laugh, sounding relieved.

“They’re fighting,” she said louder. Hadn’t he heard her right?

“Yes. Yes. Shaloonya is a good fighter,” Garon said with a wave of his hand.

“But...but they are fighting.”

Garon yawned. “Shaloonya is teaching Tache.” He went back into the bedroom, closing the door.

Tache brushed against her legs.

Mew.

“Teaching?” She knelt to searching his fur. There wasn’t a scratch on him. “Sorry Tache. You looked like you were beating up Shaloonya.”

Tache flicked his tail, looking please, eyeing Shaloonya who sat half hidden by the edge of the sofa, peering around with one big yellow eye.

“I thought you were really fighting,” Paxine said, picking Tache up and putting him in her lap. He rolled in her lap, pretending to bite her nose. She laughed.

“I guess I should have known better. There wasn’t any fur flying.”

Tache jumped back onto the floor, boxing with Shaloonya. Then she dove at him and they raced around the sofa. Shaloonya was faster with her paws and could land more blows. Tache was a better jumper, which he had to be to avoid Shaloonya’s lightning fast paws.

Garon came out of the bedroom fully clothed just when Tache sailed over the sofa in a single leap, skidding into the kitchen chair, knocking it over.

“You have to watch your landing zone,” he said with a chuckle, putting on the kettle for tea.

Tache trotted off behind the sofa as if embarrassed, creeping from behind the sofa into a corner to lie down. He had but a moment of rest when Shaloonya followed the same path and landed on him. There was a brief tangle of tails and legs, and then the two fell still. They had worn each other out.

“I have cereal and toast,” he said, putting bowls onto the table and then righting the chair.

“Sounds good. I’m hungry,” she said, grabbing a bowl.

“Pour me a bowl, too.” He popped toast into the toaster.

He poured tea with milk and sugar. The toast popped up and he slathered on butter. She thought it was the best breakfast she had ever had.

“I thought only my grandma… and I had Tails,” she said after breakfast, helping cleanup, hoping for more of an answer than what her grandma gave her.

“Oh, no. Anyone in the family…uhm can have a Tail. Most people have Tails and don’t even know it. Of course, they aren’t as well trained as ours,” he said, looking at Tache and Shaloonya on the sofa.

“Why are they called Tails?”

Garon looked at her as if she was speaking a different language. “Why are they called cats?”

This wasn’t the answer she was expecting. “I-I…”

“They are cats. They are Tails. Cats have always been Tails,” Garon said, scratching his nose. “It’s not the Tail that is special, like you think Tache is special. The person they protect is special. It takes a special person to understand a Tail. To everyone who sees him, he’s a cat. However, you don’t see a cat. You see a friend, a companion. You can talk to him. He talks to you. You understand each other. You are part of each other.”

She nodded.

“And you think that’s normal,” he said.

She nodded again.

“But it’s not,” he said, surprising her. “Tache will be your Tail for the rest of his life. When he goes, it will hurt. It will hurt until you get another Tail. It’s unfortunate that our Tails live such shorter lives than we do. Shaloonya is my seventh Tail, and I hope my last.”

For a moment, he looked tired, then he smiled and his eyes gleamed with energy and mischievousness. “Now, we have some training to do today while the Tails are resting.”

“How long have you known my grandma?” she said, awed by what she had just learned.

He laughed. “All my life. Well, actually, all hers. I am a few years older.”

“You grew up together?”

“Shh,” He looked around as if he would find someone listening. “Don’t tell. We are brother and sister.”

“What? You’re my uncle! No, my great uncle. So cool,” She dropped her voice to a whisper. “Why can’t anyone know?”

“I break a lot of laws,” he said, sounding as if that was all he did. “Well, you know the adage that you have to spend money to make money? Well, sometimes you have to break laws to keep the law. So I keep a low profile, and with your dad, being who he is, I have to be even more careful so no one finds out and uses it against him.”

“Wow. The things that go on that I don’t know about.” She hoped all that he said was really true.

“You don’t know the half of it, but you will be learning. I need to teach you how to get through government security so you can attend the Gala Ball, since you are underage and don’t have an invitation. The invitation part being the actual problem,” he said, dropping his voice to a mutter on the last sentence.

“The Ball?” She wondered how many more surprises she was to learn.

“Yes. Yes,” he said, muttering and looking at his hands as if they held the answer.

“I’m going to the Ball?” That was impossible. Her parents would never let her go to the Ball.

“Didn’t I just say that?” He looked at her as if she was forgetful.

“But the Ball? I don’t have anything to wear.” She was thinking of how impossible going to the Ball would be.

“That’s not the problem,” he said with some strain to his voice. “Oh.” He was muttering again. “That’s right. We’ll use some of your dad’s security for an invitation. You are his daughter. Oh, that was quite easy.” He chuckled, looking lighthearted again.

“I’m glad that’s easy,” she said having no idea what he meant.

“Well, now, we can continue training. Shaloonya has been teaching Tache defensive moves. He appears to have quite a knack for the rolling trip,” he said as if he was going down a list of things to do.

“The what?” She was confused, wanting to know more about the Ball.

“Rolling trip. He rolls into your legs to trip you. Now, you need to learn a few moves.”

“I don’t think I want to learn the rolling trip.” She was thinking now she was going to throw herself in front of someone to trip them.

He laughed, slapping his knees. “That would be interesting to watch, but, no, you need to learn how to get out of a grip if someone grabs you.”

He grabbed one of her arms. “Now get away.”

She lunged forward, kicking up one leg.

“Ow,” He released her and hopped on one foot. “My shin.”

“Oh, I’m so sorry,” she said, horrified.

He laughed, still hopping and rubbing his shin. “That’s good. Very good. You remember that move.”

“Are you okay?” she said, worried about how hard she kicked him.

“I’m fine,” he said with a laugh. “Now, watch these holds. See where my hand is? See between my fingers and thumb? That is the weak spot. If someone grabs you and you can see their hand, pull away between the fingers and thumb. Sometimes, if you lean into them that can confuse them because they think you should be struggling to get away.”

Garon danced around her like a wrestler, an old arthritic wrestler, grabbing at her. She laughed, pushing into his grip and getting away. Garon didn’t dance very long, getting tired, and sitting down.

“Now, getting out of a grip is often not enough. You have legs and I feel you know how to use them,” he said, rubbing his shin again. “But you also have teeth,”

“And claws?” she said with a laugh, being silly.

“Oh, yes,” he said, being serious. “Using fingernails is good too.” He put a finger right by her eyes. “Now if I poke you in the eye that’s going to hurt.”

She flinched.

“For the nose, use the palm of your hand. Don’t do like in the movies and use your fist. You’ll just get hurt.” He demonstrated how to use the palm of her hand, making her practice.

Her stomach gurgled. Already? Didn’t they just have breakfast?

“Oh, yes. Lunch. 11:30,” he said, pulling bread out of a cupboard along with peanut butter. “Can you grab the jam out of the frig?”

She pulled a jar of strawberry jam out of the frig, handing it to him.

“Now,” he said while they ate, “remember pointy things. Sometimes you need more than hands and feet. You need a weapon, but a weapon is best when it’s not a weapon.”

Her tongue was stuck with peanut butter so she gave him a quizzical look.

He reached into a pocket, pulling out a bracelet. There were two keys attached to it.

“Slip a key between your fingers and a quick jab of your hand will cause quite a pain point,” he said, demonstrating by spearing a cookie out of a package.

“Poor cookie,” she said, poking the package with her finger, which couldn’t get through the package like the key did.

“This is yours,” he said, handing her the cookie, then spearing out a cookie for himself. “This is for you. Your first weapon,” he said, handing her the bracelet.

She slipped the bracelet around her wrist. A weapon that wasn’t a weapon. She felt an odd sense of power knowing that she was armed.

Garon cleared lunch dishes and led her back out to the living room. He showed her more moves and before she knew it, he dashed in to the kitchen to make dinner. She set the table. Dinner was pasta with evening entertainment provided by two Tails, practicing mock fights.

Garon yawned. “Time for bed.”

“What? It’s only seven o’clock,” She said, holding back her own yawn.

“We got lots to do tomorrow. Best to be up early,” he said, heading for the bedroom.

“Oh, okay,” she said, thinking about her gamer. “Good night.”

Paxine settled on the couch with a blanket and pillow, much more comfortable than the night before. Her gamer sat on the floor beside her. She closed her eyes, pretending to sleep. The bedroom door clicked and all was quiet.

Paxine opened her eyes. Tache was sleeping beside her. The room was lit up with the morning sun. She couldn’t believe she had fallen asleep so early. Well, maybe she could sneak in a game before Garon got up, but a trip to the bathroom first.

“Good morning. Up and early.,” Garon said, already dressed and setting the table for breakfast when she came out of the bathroom. “We have a busy day.”

He bustled about as if half the day was gone despite the clock showed it was just after 6 A.M. Tache and Shaloonya curled up on the sofa as if they had already had a busy morning.

Paxine couldn’t figure out what else Garon could show her. He stepped her through the moves from yesterday and then showed her some other self-defensive moves. Then he dashed into the kitchen.

“Lunch? Already?” Her stomach gurgled in answer and the clock showed it was noon. How could time fly by so fast?

Lunch was more peanut butter and jam sandwiches. Afterwards, Garon bought out a tiny computer.

“I’ll need to create a security badge for you. To do so, I need some information,” he said, clicking away on the keyboard.

“Okay, name is Paxine Annitta Cushing. Age twelve, I mean age twenty-one. Gotta make you older. Birthday ….Yes, I know that too. Now we have to change the year. Okay, let us take that and transfer it over here,” he said, not needing her assistance at all. He already knew everything about her.

His fingers flew over the keyboard. Then he hooked up a small printer. It spit out a laminated security badge with her name on it.

“Maravilhoso,” he said in Portuguese.

“Wonderful,” she said in English.

“Exactly. Now the invitation.”

Paxine felt a wave of excitement. The Gala Ball. Oh, but… What was she going to wear? She didn’t have anything at home that was fancy enough for a Ball. And could she even go home?

Garon seemed unaware of her dilemma while he tapped away on the computer, glancing at her new security card to make sure he duplicated the information correctly. The printer shook to life, printing out an invitation to the Gala Ball.

“Paxine Cushing and Guest,” she said, reading aloud.

“That’s how I’m going to get into the Gala Ball. As your guest.” He rose and disappearing into the bedroom.

“I got something for you to hold your…” he said, showing a little white cloth pouch with straps. “This should fit under your shirt. Put your valuables in there. This badge and invitation for starters.”

He reached into one of his own pockets and pulled out a cash card. “Here, add this just in case you need money.”

“Can I get a cube with this new ID?” She looked at the ID with awe.

“You need more than an ID for a cube,” he said, glancing at the clock in the kitchen “Goodness time does fly.”

“It’s only four.”

“Early dinner and early to bed.” He set a pan of water to boil on the stove. While he waited, he sat at the table, seeming to be tired from their training.

The apartment didn’t have much in it. The cabinets had the barest of pans and dishes. Paxine figured the food supply was also limited. Cereal for breakfast. Peanut butter and jam for lunch. Pasta for dinner. She had to remember she was on the run, so to speak. Besides, the Tails ate the same food day after day.

Dinner was quick. She put away the last plate while Garon wiped the table. Tache and Shaloonya turned in unison, staring at a wall.

Through Tache’s ears, she heard four separate car doors from the front of the building. Then there were three more from the back. Shaloonya’s ears flinched with each door and Paxine knew Garon was hearing the same.

No one said a word. Paxine grabbed her backpack and Garon grabbed his computer. With great care, he let them out of the apartment, closing the door without a sound. The hall was empty, but there was the faint noise of music and television leaking out from the other apartments. Paxine expected Garon to head down the stairs, but he headed up one flight, to the door of the nearest apartment.

Garon picked the lock. An elderly couple sat watching television with the volume up so loud, that Garon didn’t need to be quiet when he shut the door. He led her down the hall, into a bedroom, closing the door behind them. There was a single window, facing a window in the next building. However the next building, although close, was far from within reach, and they were five floors up.

Garon opened the window, and to her surprise, picked up Shaloonya, tossing her over to the other window. She landed with ease onto the window ledge, stood on her hind legs, and pushed up with her front. The window opened a few inches. Then she put her head and shoulders under the window, pushing it open further, and disappearing inside.

He picked up Tache next, and to her horror, tossed him out the window. His toss was as good as his first, and Tache landed on the ledge and disappeared inside. Paxine swallowed hard. He wasn’t going to do that to her was he?

Garon patted his pockets until he found the right one, pulling out a large hook on a string. He twirled the hook, tossing it out the window into the other, giving it a tug to make sure the hook caught. He eased out of the window, jumping across to the other window, and then easing himself into the room using the hook and string to steady him.

Paxine knew she couldn’t jump that far, expecting Garon to throw her the string and hook, but there was no string in his hands when he leaned out the window. Was he expecting her to jump and catch his hands?

She put a leg over the window and leaned. His hands were still a few feet away. She was going to have to jump, putting both feet on the window ledge.

He nodded, showing her he was ready. She pushed off the ledge, aiming for his hands. For a moment, she felt herself free fall, then warm, dry hands firmly caught her hands. There she hung, stretched between the two windows, one foot stuck, keeping her from swinging over to Garon.

“My foot’s caught,” she said, trying to twist it loose.

There was a hard pull to her leg. Was Garon trying to pull her leg off? Her heart skipped a beat. Garon wasn’t pulling. There was a man holding her foot, trying to pull her out of Garon’s grasp.

Paxine kicked once with her free foot, withdrawing it as quick as she could when she felt the man try to grab it.

What was she going to do? Her ring. She could touch the ring on him, zap him and get free…but let a hand go? Five floors up? She couldn’t even see the ground since the evening sun failed to light up the alley. There was no way she was going to let go of Garon.

The man pulled her foot hard and Garon pulled back. She felt like a clothesline stretched tight. Panic tightened in her chest and she felt Garon’s hands slip. He renewed his grip, leaning further out of the window, putting himself dangerously close to falling out.

Tache.

She thought she heard someone scream his name.

Tache.

Four paws ran across her body. A scream rattled the windows. She felt herself fall.

Wham.

Her shoes slammed into the side of the building, but Garon still held her hands. He hauled her up through the window. But she felt like she was still falling.

“Tache,” she said, finding that she was the one screaming his name. Garon slammed shut the window, grabbing her hand, dragging her out of the vacant apartment.

“Tache,” Paxine said again, only to find Garon’s hand covering her mouth.

She felt herself propelled along, following Shaloonya who led the way down the hallway and then up the stairs, back down a hallway and down what felt like a dozen stairs cases. Nothing made sense. Where were they going?

Tears streamed down her cheek, blinding her. Garon pushed her stumbling along by her shoulder as if she was a reluctant child.

She didn’t understand. Tache. He had fallen. Why wasn’t Garon going back for him? Where was he taking her? Where were they?

They entered yet another building. Eerie footsteps echoed around them.

Tache.

Tache was gone.

She hurt.

The echoing footsteps faded when Garon steered her out onto an old train platform. The city, instead of tearing it down, built around it. The platform ended at the door of another building. He headed for that door, but then stopped midway across the platform. A man came out, pointing a gun at them.

“You’re too predictable,” the man said, laughing and walking toward them with a cocky bounce to his step. He looked pleased.

“Now would be a good time,” Garon said.

Paxine thought that was a strange thing to say. And to who?

“Now would be a good time for what?” the man said, still smiling and pleased with himself.

“There are only two of us,” Garon said.

Paxine couldn’t understand why Garon was being so strange. She didn’t think it was wise to confuse a man who had a gun aimed at you.

“So?” The man did seem confused.

“There should be four,” Garon said as if teaching a child math.

The man stared, but Paxine’s mind cleared, and she understood, sort of. Where was Shaloonya?

There was movement out of the corner of her eye. Garon looked away toward the old tracks. It was the tactic her grandma taught her when Tache checked her food. The man with the gun followed Garon’s gaze.

A blur hit the man’s hand and another blur rolled into his feet. Garon pulled out a box and aimed it at the man. The man was unconscious when he hit the ground.

Garon hurried over to the man and rummaged through his pockets, removing weapons. Paxine found she couldn’t move. There was Tache, standing now by the tracks, keeping watch. She wanted to run and hold him. All this training and she had forgotten to reach out to him to know where and how he was. In a time of crisis, she had forgotten to use the chain on her ankle. She reached out to him now and felt him very much alive, alert, and unhurt from his plunge down five stories.

She joined Garon, feeling numb and stupid. Her only pain was her toes from her feet slamming into the building.

“Someone will be along shortly to pick him up,” Garon said, fastening a blinking button onto the man. He squeezing Paxine’s hand to reassure her, leading her back out the way they came and onto the street.

The dinner crowd filled the streets with the last of the rush hour. Restaurants were busy, venting their delicious smells out onto the street. She felt some comfort being within the crowd, still dazed with what just happened.

A few blocks later, Garon released her hand. Tache urged her to slow down. She felt uncomfortable while Garon went on ahead, disappearing into the crowd. There were shops and restaurant windows along the walk so she pretended to window shop, pretending her mom wasn’t too far away. No matter what she pretended, she was still in an unfamiliar area, surrounded by strangers. Scary.

Paxine found herself walking faster, wanting to run, but Tache urged her to slow down. There was a restaurant. All its doors and windows were open. She stopped to watch people eat. No one seemed to notice her, so she pretended she was invisible, continuing down the street. She reached out to Tache for comfort and he was pleased with her pace, guiding her into the door of another restaurant.

There was a foyer with the choice of going straight through another door into the restaurant, or going up a flight of stairs. Tache directed her up the stairs, leading to a banquet hall. At the far end of the hall, Garon was just sitting down at a table.

“Are you okay?” he said, looking tired.

“I-I think so. Nothing hurts. Well, maybe my toes,” she said, checking the deep scuff marks on the toes of her shoes where they hit the building. “I-I hurt and thought I lost Tache, but…I was just scared.”

“Both of us. They found us too quickly. That’s not good.” However, he didn’t look worried about it.

“How?”

“They were scanning apartments and looking for apartments that were vacant but had people. Simple really,” he said matter-of-fact.

“They… they knew where you would run to,” She gave a worried, looking around as if another gun toting man was about to barge through the doorway.

“Oh,” he said with a blush as if modest. “I did that on purpose. Had to give Tache time to catch up with us. We back tracked a little and let them get wind of us. They are the ones who are so predictable.” He chuckled looking pleased with himself as if he had performed some sort of clever trick.

“Will they find us again?”

“Probably, but they won’t look here,” he said with confidence.

“Why not?” She wondered why no one would look here or find them just as easily in the apartment.

“Too many people here and I hate this restaurant. The governor owns it and security is strict.” He looked totally serious.

“We just walked right in,” she said, looking dubious.

“Exactly. They’re secure against the wrong things. We don’t have any guns on us. We don’t have any traceable tracking devices, recorders, or such. All the things they’re strict about, we don’t have. They’ll never know we’re here.” He leaned on the table with a yawn.

“How long are we going to be here?”

“Just for the night. We have places to go tomorrow.” He looked like he would fall asleep at the table.

“Okay.” She felt Tache getting further and further away. “Where’s Tache going?”

“Shaloonya and he are tracking a couple of guys. They’ll be gone all night.” Garon yawned again.

“Tache fell. How did he…”

“Ask him.” Garon closed his eyes.

Tache, she thought, how did you….? An image formed before she could complete her thought. Tache had attacked the man, biting and scratching. The man released his hold on her, flinging Tache away toward the building on the other side. Tache used his momentum toward the building to push off to a window ledge on the other building, one floor below, jumping again, zigzagging between buildings and window ledges, controlling his descent, until he landed in a trash bin. Her heart beat fast all over again

The door of the restaurant opened, causing her to jump, but it was just customers coming and going. Then the door closed one last time with a solid click. The lights dimmed. For an hour, there were still sounds from below while the staff cleaned and readied the restaurant for the next day. Then there was one last slam of a door and silence.

Paxine couldn’t understand why she was lying on the floor of a bus. It shook. The floor was hard. It was uncomfortable. She just wanted to sleep. The bus stopped. Someone shook her shoulder. It must be her stop.

“Wakey wakey. Time for breakfast,” Garon said, shaking her shoulder.

She felt startled to find herself on the floor of the banquet hall.

“Breakfast,” he said again, helping her up.

She stretched the kinks out of her body, following him to the back of the banquet area. Stairs led down to the kitchen. There were no locked doors.

“Strict security?” she said, letting sarcasm in her voice.

“Not in the kitchen. Only in the main restaurant area,” he said in explanation.

“Yeah, right.” She was thinking security was rather lacking. “Where’s the restroom?”

“Take a step out that door and look, but don’t go into the main area of the restaurant.” He was looking through the kitchen.

“I see the restroom. It’s in the same hallway. Is that safe?” she said.

He nodded.

The light in the restroom turned on when she entered, scaring her. The reflection in the mirror that stared back at her scared her a second time. Her hair was wild and her clothes rumpled. She finger combed her hair and smoothed out her clothes the best she could.

When she returned to the kitchen, it now smelled of frying eggs. Toast popped up. Garon slid an egg onto a piece of toast and handed it to her.

“No dishes, except the pan,” he said with a wink.

He finished his egg sandwich, then took his turn in the restroom.

Paxine snuck a peek in the huge refrigerator for something to drink. There was a rack of puddings. She slurped one down. To hide what she did, she washed the bowl and made sure her face was clean by the time he was back.

“Hum. Pudding,” he said with a glint in his eye.

Paxine tried to look like she didn’t know what he meant.

“I had one too,” he said with a wink, leading her back up the stairs into the banquet hall.

She expected to head down the stairs they had come originally, but he led her away to another set of stairs. These stairs led down and out into the street. The doors locked only against people trying to come in, not out. No one paid any attention to them as they joined the early commute crowd.

Paxine reached out to Tache, finding him still far away, but to her relief, Garon was leading her in that direction. She felt good having a full belly and knowing Tache was getting closer. The early morning walk felt good, until she noticed…

“We’re going around the block,” Paxine said, “for the second time.”

Garon smiled, but didn’t answer. He was humming.

“Why…”

Garon interrupted her, putting a finger to his lips. She felt frustrated. They weren’t going anywhere. This wasn’t getting her closer to Tache.

“But…” she said, being more demanding.

Garon interrupted her again, stepping off the curb, heading across the street toward a car. A man, standing next to the car, opened the back door.

“Garon….” she said, alarmed.

Garon didn’t seem worried, in fact, he looked relieved, slipping into the back seat with a tired sigh.

“No cube?” she said in a quiet voice as the man shut the door behind her and got into the driver’s seat.

“Cars a little too old fashion for you?” he said, whispering back to her.

“No, but…” she said, confused.

“It’s harder to be tracked by car than by cube,” he said in explanation.

“Oh.” She hadn’t ever thought of that. However, she did think that Garon had arranged for the car. She wondered where they were going, but was afraid to ask. The driver didn’t pay them any attention, but she didn’t know if it was wise to ask. Then she thought she was being silly. Of course, the driver knew where they were going. He was taking them. So how did he know where they wanted to go? She didn’t hear Garon tell him.

Paxine found it hard to ride in silence with so many questions on her tongue. She didn’t know if she could ask or even should ask. Garon rode in silence, twiddling his thumbs, staring out the window. She decided to do what he did.

The city buildings all looked alike to her. They weren’t very interesting until the car passed a familiar shop. This was her mom’s favorite shopping district. Why were they going into a shopping district? A twinge of excitement tickled her spine.

The car stopped at the end of the street.

“It’s a little early,” Garon said, closing the door of the car. The car drove off and he strolled up the street. “I think, though, that some places are opening early to help with the Gala Ball customers who are doing all their last minute shopping.” He chuckled. “Like us.”

“We’re getting me a dress,” she said, feeling the twinge of excitement tingled all the way up her spine.

“Don’t you need one?” he said, heading into the first store. “You can’t go like that.”

’I-I…I know that,” she said with a laugh.

Paxine knew this store well from shopping with her mom. However, this was the first time she was excited to be there.

“May I help you?” the clerk said, modeling one of the more expensive gowns. Her makeup and hair looked professionally done. A practiced smile played on her lips as she looked from one to the other. She settled on Garon.

“An evening dress,” he said.

“Blue,” Paxine said. This was her dress to the Ball. She was going to pick it out. “Light blue, not dark.”

“Yes, good choice,” the clerk said to Garon, moving over to some racks, ignoring Paxine.

“How much is on the cash card,” Paxine said, pretending to check out a dress on a nearby rack.

“More than you could spend, even in here,” he said, heading for a chair.

Paxine decided she could shop like her mom and get a proper dress for the Ball. The designer racks were over by the window. She passed a mirror that showed her wrinkled play clothes and her messy hair. No wonder the clerk headed to the clearance racks.

“That dress is five thousand,” the clerk spoke, articulating each word, trying to decide if she needed to speak to Garon or Paxine. She had a slight upward tilt to her nose, and chose to lean toward Garon.

“Within my budget,” Paxine said, thrusting the dress into the clerk’s hands.

The clerk changed her focus to Paxine when Garon sat, seeming to ignore them, unconcerned with how expensive or not a dress was.

Paxine had the feeling that he was humming, looking quite serene. She whipped through the racks, finding another dress. Now she knew why her mom liked to shop.

A warm sensation surrounded her ankle. Tache was checking up on her. He was still far away, but felt like he was coming closer. He told her he was still with Shaloonya.

***

Tache didn’t like all the trash in the alley, feeling at any moment something was going to jump out at him. He was following Shaloonya, trying to keep watch behind him at the same time. Shaloonya’s tail poked his eye, making him hop sideways to avoid running into her. An alley cat barred their path, glaring with menace. Scars streaked across his face and chunks were missing from both ears. The cat hissed a territorial warning.

Shaloonya glared back. Her tail flicked once as her only warning, lunging with claws and teeth, becoming a blur of swinging claws. Tache jumped after her, managing to get a mouthful of fur before the alley cat fled, with both Tails close behind.

The chase ended at the edge of the alley only because Shaloonya stopped, letting the alley cat escape under parked cars. Tache spit out fur. A steady stream of people passed. Shaloonya took a step during a lull in the foot traffic, but didn’t go any further. Tache glared. Was she afraid of the dog?

A man walking a big dog passed them. Tache shook his head free of the last bit of fur, lashing his tail at her. She ignored him, waiting until the dog was past, then moving in right behind the dog.

The dog eyed her, slid his tail between his legs and bumped, almost tripping, his owner.

“Heel,” the owner said with a growl.

Tache lashed his tail with irritation. She wasn’t afraid of the dog, she was using him as a shield. He should have thought of that.

“Heel. What is wrong with you?” The owner jerked the dog, causing it to whimper.

Tache thought he could easily pull the dog’s tail out from between its legs and really scare it. One paw length away and… Shaloonya sidestepped into him. His paw missed his target.

Grrr, Tache thought. Just wait until he was a better fighter.

Bump.

Shaloonya sidestepped into him again, pushing him under a parked car. The man and dog continued up the block.

Tache’s tail lashed in irritation, but Shaloonya ignored him, watching two cars pass, waiting for the street to clear. Her tail teased him as she dashed across, causing him to chase her across the street and up along the curb. He was about to pounce when she growled at him, reminding him this wasn’t a game. Then she hopped up into a large planter full of weeds, snaking in between the plants, settling down, hidden from view.

Tache settled as far away from her as he could, but the planter wasn’t that large so he was only a tail-length away. A breeze ruffled the weeds overhead. Whoa, those were fun. He batted at them, playing a game, until an icy stare shivered down his spine. How did she do that, he thought, ending his game.

A moment later, her icy stare focused on him again with the addition of a snarl of teeth. What? He hadn’t moved an inch. What did she… His tail, twitching, moved the weeds. He couldn’t get it to stay still. Shaloonya extended a claw as if she was going to rip his tail off. He tucked his twitching tail under his back feet, now feeling like electric shocks zapped through his tail, His tail twitch the more he thought about it. He shifted to get more comfortable but froze when Shaloonya glared at him again.

A car pulled up by a building across the street. Two men got out. This seemed to be what Shaloonya was waiting for. She told him that Garon and Paxine would rest easy as long as that car stayed put.

A breeze rifled the weeds over his head, creating a rustling movement that he used to disguise shifting his feet. How long were they going to stay here? He knew he couldn’t ask. At least she maintained her focus on the building and less on him while he made small adjustments to his twitching tail.

“Jake. Look,” a boy said, shouting near the planter.

Tache’s tail thrashed beneath him, almost causing him to run. Shaloonya gave the boy one quick glance, before returning her attention back to the car.

“Yeah, Harl. If it ain’t Mr. Jonny boy. Hey, got any money?” Jake said. He was a big boy in baggy pants and a t-shirt three times too large and he blocked the path of Jonny, a boy half his size, coming from the other way.

“N-n-n-o,” Jonny said, backing off.

Tache’s tail twitched hard under his feet again.

“Oh, what else ya got then?” Jake said, shoving Jonny.

“Where’s your gamer?” Harl said, stepping behind Jonny and shoving him back to Jake. He was a hand smaller than Jake, wearing a sport jersey that an adult twice his size would wear. Frayed holes in his jeans let his knobby knees stick out.

“I-I,” Johnny said, eyes huge, scanning around for someone to help him.

Jake shoved Jonny back to Harl with a laugh.

“I-I don’t got one,” Jonny said, his eyes even bigger with the realization that no one was around to save him.

“What are ya gonna give us?” Harl said, shoving Jonny back to Jake.

Tache’s tail twitched hard, almost breaking free, shifting him to one side. The hairs stood up on the back of his neck. The boys pushed Johnny one more time, and Tache found himself sliding out of the planter down by the curb. He crouched, slinking fast along the curb until he was as near as he could get to the boys.

Jake reached up to give Johnny another shove when his legs buckled beneath him, and he landed with his breath knocked out of him. Harl seemed dumbfounded until…

“Ow. It bit me,” Harl said, yelling at the top of his lungs.

“Wha? Wha?” Jake’s couldn’t catch his breath fast enough. “Ahhhh,” Jake said, getting tangled in his baggy pants, tearing them. “I’m bleeding. My elbow.”

“Ow, it bit me,” Harl said with a shout, trying to sound more serious than Jake.

“What was it?” Jake said, examining his scraped elbow, as if he had never seen anything like it before.

“Dunno. Raccoon?” Harl said, hopping about on one foot as if putting his bitten ankle down would cause more damage.

“A raccoon? Get away. Those got rabies,” Jake said, running in terror.

“Noooo.” Harl said with a scream, limping after Jake.

Jonny was already half-way down the street, running as fast as he could.

Tache’s tail smacked into the curb. He didn’t like those mean boys, feeling good that he had gotten them out of the way. Shaloonya should be pleased too, now that they weren’t interfering. He slipped back up into the planter expecting praise, but met an icy glare instead.

Shaloonya looked as if she was going to attack him, giving him a silent hiss, showing all her teeth. Tache felt as if she had grown to double her size. He settled back into the planter, keeping as far away from her as he could.

His tail, fearing for its life, didn’t flinch even once, even when people passed, sending pigeons flapping overhead. His focus on staying still seemed to be unflappable, except for an irritating vibration. It penetrated his whole body, even making the planter feel as if it was shaking. His aural ring tingled, sending irritating sensations down his ear.

Tache had to move. He had to leave. The limit was reached as to how much he could take, propelling him out of the planter. He knew he was dead, feeling that Shaloonya followed him to make the death strike. However, she passed him, staying low to the ground, using the curb and parked cars as cover as she moved up the street.

His tail, finally free of restrictions, smacked the curb with every step he took. He wasn’t dead. Shaloonya hadn’t struck. What happened?

A delivery truck pulled up beside them, causing Shaloonya to stop so quick that he almost stepped on her tail. He received a glare that told him to be careful and not to move.

The driver ran past them with a package, disappearing into the shop nearby. Shaloonya dashed over to a nearby sewer grate, rubbed her paws on it and then dashed back to Tache.

The driver ran back out of the shop and into his truck, driving off. He delivered one package but picked up two new ones that he didn’t know about.

Tache tucked himself behind the seat of the driver so he could see out the door of the truck. The truck paused at the end of the block. Two men jogged by, heading up the street, each holding the leash of a large dog. Tache tensed, hoping the truck moved. The dogs sniffed where he helped the boy, then moved up to the planter and along the curb to the sewer.

The truck jerked into gear, rolling around the corner. Tache dug his claws into the carpet on the floor to keep his balance. Something sharp grabbed his tail and he jerked it away.

Shaloonya’s claws, with shreds of his fur, flexed. She was furious with him, hissing to let him know they failed their mission because of him. He had revealed himself. The enemy used a scanner to find them, thus causing the irritation to their aural rings. Her eyes glared at him as if they were lasers shredding him to pieces.

Well, at least they could go back to Paxine, he thought.

Shaloonya shook her head, dashing his hopes. They couldn’t go back until they found another way to watch the building.

Tache’s tail whipped against the side of the truck in frustration.

The driver looked out his side mirror to see what hit his truck.

***

“This one,” Paxine said, twirling in front of the mirror. The dress was light blue, which matched her eyes. Sequins covered the bodice and soft-layered chiffon made up the skirt. She accessorized with silver high-heeled shoes that made her three inches taller. It was simple, yet elegant. And the most expensive dress.

“This is an original. Everyone wants this one, but not everyone can wear it. You certainly can,” the clerk said, pouring on the compliments.

Paxine expected Garon to comment on the price, but he only nodded. He seemed distracted and then he frowned.

“You don’t like the dress?” she said.

“The dress is perfect,” he said with a smile.

Paxine headed back to the dressing room, catching him checking a pocket and then frowning again. Something was going on and it didn’t seem good. She didn’t take long to slip out of the dress, handing it to the clerk.

Garon was checking another pocket when she came out of the changing room, but this time he smiled. She placed the cash card on the counter while the clerk covered the dress in plastic. The clerk scanned the card and the purchase was completed.

“This is the coolest dress ever. Thanks,” she said when they left the shop.

“Yes. You needed one,” he said.

Paxine wasn’t surprised this time when the car pulled up. Garon hung the dress on the hook over the door. Even covered in plastic, the dress glittered.

“I think even my mom would be jealous about this dress.”

“Especially since she didn’t pay for it.” He chuckled.

Paxine laughed. Garon began to hum, twiddling his thumbs. She thought it was funny and found herself enjoying the ride. The view was the same dull city buildings, but a quick peek away was the most beautiful dress she had ever owned.

“Where we going?” she said, feeling comfortable asking.

“City central.”

“Cool.” She knew that area. “How far is it?” Cars seemed to be slow and she felt like she had been riding in the car forever.

“Depends on traffic.”

Traffic was picking up the further they moved into the city. She didn’t know if she liked cars. Cubes seemed so much faster and there wasn’t any cube traffic.

“Why don’t everyone have cubes?” she said.

He chuckled. “They are controlled and very limited.”

“My dad has one.”

“Your dad is special. You actually have two. Your dad has one and your mom.”

“How come cubes are faster?” she said, letting the questions fly, especially since she was getting answers.

“Different technology than cars. Cubes travel on light. Cars travel on roads. Light is faster,” he said, watching out the window.

“Oh.” She was thinking of a whole bunch more questions, but the car entered City Central.

There was a fountain and a number of sculptures in the center of a drive where taxis dropped people off. Their driver pulled in, they hopped out, and the driver drove off. Garon carried the dress.

The lunch crowd was just beginning to fill the area. He headed toward a nearby café that sat up on a raised patio. There was already a line and they joined it. It was a pleasant wait since it was a beautiful sunny day with a slight breeze to make it comfortable.

A delivery truck rumbled to a stop across the street. The driver ran out with his packages into a store. In moments, he ran back into his truck, and drove away.

“I didn’t know they delivered Tails,” she said, feeling Tache.

“I don’t think they know either,” he said with a chuckle, looking out over the crowd for the Tails he couldn’t see.

“How many, please?” the young, high-energy waiter said.

“Two,” Garon said, raising two fingers.

The waiter rushed them to their table, tossed down two menus and was gone. Paxine already knew what she wanted, having seen it on someone’s plate when they passed; hot dog and a soda. Her mom would have said no to the soda, and then try to interest her in a salad.

Warm, soft fur brushed against her legs. Without looking down, Paxine repositioned her backpack so Tache could hop in. She felt relief from him that he was with her. He complained about Shaloonya being upset.

Shaloonya was nowhere in sight. Garon didn’t carry anything to hold Shaloonya and she wondered how he hid her.

“Where is…” she said.

“She stays aloof,” he said, anticipating her question, as he draped her dress over an empty chair.

The waiter skidded to a stop by their table.

“Soda for both of us,” Garon said before the waiter could speak. The man dashed off again.

Garon leaned back, looking relaxed like he was enjoying the sunshine.

“Something’s changed,” she said.

He raised his eyebrows.

“We’re sitting here rather leisurely,” she said.

“Tache did something remarkable.” He looked awed.

The waiter plopped their drinks down.

“I’ll have the club sandwich with chips,” Garon said, before the waiter could ask.

“Hot dog. Oh, with fries,” she said, feeling like she had to order in a hurry before the waiter dashed off again.

Garon sipped his drink, watching the people.

“What did he do?” She wondered what Tache did that was remarkable other than open doors and drawers.

“Who?” He appeared absentminded.

“Tache,” she said, reminding him.

“Ah, yes. He protected someone that wasn’t his to protect.”

“What does that mean?”

“A Tail normally protects their person and no one else. That’s a full time job.” He took a sip of soda.

She nodded in agreement. Tache was very busy and she had to be careful that he got enough sleep.

“Tache went out of his way to protect a young boy from a couple of bullies. That’s rare in a Tail,” he said, meeting her eyes. “That’s very good. A Tail that thinks about the safety of others and not just his person and himself is almost unheard of.”

“But Tache said Shaloonya was very upset.”

“Because he jeopardized their position. She was only thinking of herself and me. She didn’t care about the boy or even Tache, for that matter. By saving the boy, Tache revealed his presence. Shaloonya managed to have them escape in the sewer, or at least that’s probably what the men they were watching believed. We know how they escaped and how they were delivered.” He looked across the street where the delivery truck had stopped earlier.

Tache was filling her in on the details while Garon spoke. His version of the story was matching Garon’s, except Tache said Shaloonya tried to rip his tail off.

“However, by revealing his presence, the men realized I knew where they were and that I was watching. They panicked and moved their operation.” He looked pleased.

“Now you don’t know where they are,” she said, wondering why he was pleased.

“On the contrary,” he said with a chuckle. “That’s why I’m so pleased with Tache. The men moved their operation into a building that I already watch in other ways. The building they picked told me a few things about them that I won’t go into right now.”

“How do you know this?” shee said, knowing she had been with Garon the whole time and he never got even a phone call to inform him.

“Gadgets,” he said, patting his pockets. “Alarms came in and alerted me while you were shopping.”

“Oh, that’s why you frowned. I thought it was the dress.”

Garon sipped his soda.

“But if he jeopardized his position, that also jeopardized me,” she said.

“Your Tail is devoted to you. Tache is young. He probably didn’t understand just what he and Shaloonya were doing. However, the fact that he is young and helped that young boy is extraordinary. Younger Tails tend to be more self-centered than the more experienced ones. Your grandma is extremely pleased.” He leaned back when the waiter skidded in with their food.

Paxine didn’t realize how hungry she was, and the food made her forget to ask how her grandma knew already. She stuffed her mouth, feeling that if she didn’t eat fast, something would happen to cause them to have to run. Good junk food wasn’t something she liked to waste. However, Garon continued to be at ease, savoring his food. She finished long before him. However, she had saved one piece of hot dog.

“You don’t have to worry about feeding your Tail,” Garon said, seeming to read her mind.

However, Paxine noticed when he flicked something into a nearby planter. She folded her napkin onto her plate making the piece of hot dog disappear into her hand and into her backpack. Her ankle chain warmed with Tache’s enjoyment of his snack. That is when she realized her backpack needed an emergency care kit for him, and she resolved to put one together as soon as she could.

Paxine tilted her glass to get the last drop of her soda. “That was good.”

A pigeon landed in the planter near Garon only to squawk and flap off, leaving behind two feathers. He chuckled, rising and leaving money on the table. The waiter dashed in.

“All yours,” Garon said.

“Thank you, sir. Come again,” the waiter said, grabbing the money and their dishes.

The flowers moved in the planter and Shaloonya dropped to the ground. She padded over to Garon putting her head against his leg. He stroked her coat.

The lunch crowd was thinning now that the lunch hour was done. She hoisted up her backpack. He picked up her dress, heading straight through the area toward a side street. They were the only ones walking down this street, and the sounds of the downtown traffic faded behind them.

Paxine thought the area was creepy. Each building ended where the next began and each one was gray brick with two windows on each story. There were few businesses and most of the buildings looked like converted apartments. Curtains covered most of the windows and there was little visible behind them, except for the occasional plant plastered to the window looking for more light. She expected the apartments were empty since everyone was at work.

The city blocks were long and with each block, the area became dingier and more run down. One car passed them; otherwise, there was no traffic or people in sight.

Garon crossed the street to the next block. These buildings looked boarded up and abandoned. He headed for the fourth building. There were stairs that ran up to the front door and down to a basement door. Trash littered the stoop to the basement. He headed down the stairs to the basement door, taking out a metal key from his pocket.

She didn’t know if she wanted to follow him.

“This way,” he said, unlocking and opening the door.

The room beyond the door was dim, lit by a single light bulb hidden within a dirty glass globe. At the opposite end was a doorway leading into darkness.

Garon pushed her in. “Can’t stand out there too long.”

She didn’t think she wanted to stand too long inside either. He closed the door behind them.

“This way.” He walked ahead of her to her relief.

More lights behind dirty globes, hung from the ceiling, lighting their way. Pipes and wires, of all sizes, lined the walls, hiding gritty cement. The floor crunched underfoot.

Paxine felt like they were traveling under the entire length of the city, through corridor after corridor. The air alternated between stuffy to damp to stale. The only sound was the crunching of their footsteps. Ahead of them, leading the way was the gray shadow of Shaloonya, who obviously been here before and knew her way.

The only think breaking up the monotony of the pipe-lined corridor was doors that looked like they hadn’t been opened in a hundred years. She was sure she didn’t want to open any of those doors, imagining all sort of horrors, cobwebs, and rats.

At one such door, the worst of all for rust, Shaloonya stopped. Garon reached up to a small metal box fastened to the wall, opening it without a noise. He took out a key, holding it up for her to see.

“Remember the keys on the bracelet I gave you,” he said.

Paxine raised her arm with the bracelet. One key matched the one he held. He held up another key, the key he used to open the basement door. It was the same as the other key on her bracelet.

“What good is a key if I don’t even know where I am? How would I find the door?”

“What are the numbers on the keys?” He turned them so she could read the two keys he held.

Paxine checked her keys against his.

“Forty-two,” she said, reading one key.

“The door is on 42nd street, fourth house, second door, meaning basement,” he said in explanation.

“Seventeen R?” she said, reading the second key.

“The seventeenth door on your right.” He turned the key in the door.

The door didn’t open, but the whole section of wall containing the door pivoted open.

“Wow,” she said, thinking of secret passageways. Did this lead to her grandma’s, she wondered, stepping into the corridor behind the wall.

A light switched on overhead and the section of wall pivoted closed behind them. He led the way again with lights switching on and off as if guiding them down the corridor toward a door. This door was different from all the others. It wasn’t rusty, looking brand new.

Garon placed his hand in the middle of the door. There was a whisper of gears and the door swung open. Again, lights turned on as soon as they entered the room. The door closed on its own behind them.

“Your hand will open that door, too,” he said.

Paxine blinked twice, staring at the shelves full of wire, glass and such, and the empty table in the middle of the room.

“This is your shop,” she said in amazement.

“One of my shops.” He hung her dress on a hook on the wall.

“One? You…this isn’t your shop I visited?” She was sure this was the shop she and her grandma had been in.

“Nope.” He rummaged through a nearby shelf.

“You’re sure?. It looks exactly like it. It has an empty table.” She wasn’t sure she believed him.

“The table is my workspace. You always need a clean place to work.”

Whack.

Paxine let her backpack slip to the ground, so Tache could hop out. He disappeared with Shaloonya and soon there was the faint sound of crunching. She was relieved he got to eat.

Garon put a handful of items on the table, moving to rummage through another shelf. The only sounds were the Tails crunching and of Garon rummaging. There was the faint scent of baby oil and caramel. Fine dust coated everything. She was amazed how many shelves full of things there were. She hated to think of dusting the place. Then she laughed to herself. She was sure, based on the dust, that Garon didn’t like dusting either.

She kicked her backpack out of the way and Tache’s wooden spoon fell out.

“What’s that?” Garon said, rushing past Paxine to pick it up before she could.

“It’s a spoon,” she said, thinking she stated the obvious.

“A wooden spoon.” He examined it as if he had never seen a wooden spoon before.

“It’s Tache’s spoon. We were in grandma’s spice shop. He bit it so grandma had to buy it.” She didn’t understand why he was so interested in a spoon.

“Very nice.” His voice was serious. He put the spoon on the table with the other items, then disappearing and returning with a second chair.

“Have a seat,” he said, sitting down in an old rusty metal chair. “I’d like to show you some things.”

He positioned some glasses on his nose, picked out a caramel from the items on the table, and popped it into his mouth. Next, he took a pair of tweezers and picked up some metal slivers.

Paxine didn’t think metal slivers were very interesting, even more so since they didn’t look like anything. In fact, they were almost invisible if not for Garon moving them so that light glinted off them.

“See how this one curves this way and that one curves that way?” He placed the slivers on his finger. “This one is warming up to the heat from my finger. The other one isn’t. This causes one of them to spin. As it cools, the other one picks up the heat emitted and that one spins. The result of them spinning is a wound up clock.” He looked pleased.

“Huh?” She hadn’t understand a single word he said.

He lowered the metal slivers onto the table. To her surprise, they weren’t metal slivers anymore but a spider. She blinked. A metal spider made with slivers so fine that if she hadn’t seen him put it down, she wouldn’t have known it was there.

He released the spider from his fingers. The spider crawled across the table, maneuvering over caramels and tools, stopping at the edge.

“This is a Screamer.” He looked like a kid with a new toy.

“A Screamer? It doesn’t make a sound.” She tilted her head as if listening. Was he serious?

“Not one that you can hear, but they can.” He shrugged a shoulder toward the other side of the room where Tache and Shaloonya stood, staring. Despite how tiny and invisible the Screamer was to her, the Tails pinpointed exactly where the Screamer stopped.

He picked up the Screamer with tweezers.

“What’s it for? Finding Tails?” She wondered what good was something that screamed silently?

“No, it’s for tracking people. Let me demonstrate,” he said, enclosing the Screamer in his hand. “Now, let us say I want to track you, but I don’t want you to know about it.” He stepped away from her. “I need to warm up the Screamer so it has the energy to go as far as I need it. Once it’s warm, I get as close to my target as I can and then I release the Screamer,”

He bent down as if he was checking his shoelace, releasing the Screamer, which was almost invisible crawling across the floor.

’The Screamer knows where to go,” he said, watching the Screamer head straight for her. “It needs to find a new heat source and you’re the closest warm object.”

The Screamer crawled up onto her shoe, under her jeans and onto her sock. Paxine shivered at the creepiness of it, pulling up her pant leg to reveal it attached to her sock.

“You would never have known it was there,” he said, removing the Screamer from her sock using the tweezers. “Also, no mechanical scanners or detectors would pick it up. However…” He paused, pointing at Tache and Shaloonya who were following the Screamer with their eyes. “They will be able to hear it and follow it even if it is quite some distance away. As long as it’s near a source of heat, like your body, it will continue to scream.”

“But deactivators would …” she said.

“No. You didn’t listen. No mechanical scanners or detectors will pick it up. Deactivators don’t work on a Screamer, because a Screamer works off heat, not a battery or electrical source. Here, let me show you how to make one.” He put the Screamer into a metal box.

Paxine leaned in almost touching her nose to the table. The metal slivers were so fine. She could understand why Garon used tweezers.

“See how this side is dark and this side is light?” he said, moving the metal so she could see it. “The dark absorbs the heat faster than the lighter side. This causes the metal to spin and winds up the Screamer. Heat loss activates the Screamer to move. Constant heat stops the Screamer.”

“I see,” she said, starting to understand what he was saying.

“This is physics. Something to study in a few years.” He kept his eyes on the metal slivers.

“More homework.” She rolled her eyes and laughed, but she was getting more interested in Screamers.

Garon twisted and twirled the metal slivers together, holding out the new Screamer in his hand.

“The Screamer won’t move because it has a constant source of heat, but it is screaming,” he said, pointing to the Tails whose ears were twitching. “You should see how dogs react.”

He chuckled, putting the Screamer on the table. “Now I have removed the constant heat source. It will crawl to find another heat source or until it is unwound.”

The Screamer crawled over every object on the table, dropping off the edge, landing on the floor and stopping a few feet from a cabinet.

Tache moved in to investigate, almost touching his nose to the Screamer, which came back to life, crawling toward him. He backed up, but the Screamer kept coming. Tache panicked as his butt hit the cabinet, jumping four feet over the Screamer to escape.

Garon laughed, scooping up the Screamer. “Not so good for sneaking up on Tails.” He laughed some more.

“Yeah, those are cool. Creepy though,” she said with a shiver, wiping her sock as if the Screamer was still clinging there.

“Well now. Let’s take a look at this spoon,” He spun the spoon around his fingers.

“A spoon isn’t mechanical,” she said, thinking that was why Garon liked the spoon.

“Nope. Not at all. This is a big spoon.” He tapped it with a finger while he thought. “It would make a nice weapon.”

Paxine imaged herself hitting an assailant over the head with the spoon, having the spoon break, and the assailant laughing at her.

“Are you sure?” she said, making sure he wasn’t joking.

“Oh, yes.” He jumped up with excitement to grab more tools from a shelf. “Hold this.”

She held the spoon while he drilled a hole through its entire length with a long thin drill bit. Then he slid a piece of thin white plastic tubing into the hole.

“Splendid,” he said, holding out the spoon, admiring it.

“Pea shooter?” she said, not knowing what good a spoon with a hole drilled through it was.

“What? Oh, that would be a good idea, but peas would be too big. No, this is a Popper,” Garon said as if she should know what a Popper was.

“A Popper?” Paxine said, looking very confused.

“Yep.” He twirled the spoon like a baton.

“And what does a Popper do?”

“I’ll show you,” he said, selecting a tiny black bead from a tin box. He fit it into the hole at the rounded end of the spoon. “This way.”

He led her around a cabinet to another metal door. Inside, he flipped a switch, starting a fan at the far end of the room. With a flick of his wrist, the bead shot out of the spoon, hitting the far wall. It made a loud pop, bursting into thick black smoke. The fan sucked away the smoke. He grinned as if that was the neatest thing.

“That’s it?” She was thinking maybe an explosion and black smoke would be exciting, not a pop?

“Not impressed, huh?” He led her out of the room.

“Nope.”

“Well, you would be, if I flicked it at you. It produces a lot of heat and can give you quite a burn. It can start your clothes on fire. It doesn’t take much to send it at someone. However, you do have to use a flick of the wrist, else, it won’t go. Hard to misfire it.”

“Oh. I guess that sounds more serious if it can start your clothes on fire.”

“And no one is going to disarm you of a spoon. Remember? A weapon is best when it’s not a weapon. Stick that back in your backpack, and I’ll give you a couple of beads for it,” he said, rummaging through a drawer, finding another tin box and putting Popper beads inside.

“Always wise to keep it loaded.” He loaded a bead into the spoon and handed her the spoon.

“Tache won’t mess with it, will he?” She had a right to be worried since Tache messed with everything.

“He won’t. Popper has a nasty smell to it. I think I ruined his spoon for him.” He put more metal pieces and tools on the table. “Here, let me show you how to make your own Screamers.”

He handed her a pair of tweezers. Paxine followed his instructions, putting together a spider.

“There,” he said.

“That’s it?” she said, putting the spider down, thinking putting spiders together was easy. Her spider walked across the table, stopping just before the edge. “Whoa.” She remembered the mouse that Greta gave her, pulling it out of her backpack.

“Yes, yes. Those are built on the same principle as the Screamer except it doesn’t scream.” He hardly gave the mouse a glance. His stomach gurgled. “Oh, dinner. Pizza okay? Oh, of course. Pizza is always okay.”

He dashed out the door they had come.

She wondered if he had to go all the way down the corridors. And where was a Pizza place in this part of the city? She didn’t wonder long. Instead, she put together her second spider, but added another set of legs. Now how could she get it to carry Popper beads?

“Soda?” Garon said, coming back through the door, carrying a pizza box.

She almost squashed her new spider. “Gosh, that didn’t take long.” She cleared a place on the table for the pizza.

Garon opened a cabinet, revealing a small refrigerator full of soda.

“That’s my favorite,” she, said, opening the pizza box to see what kind. Pepperoni.

“No, that’s my favorite ,” he said, filling two glasses with ice. “And I don’t share with just anybody.” He glared at her.

“You need to work on that glare.” She laughed and grabbed a glass. “So I take it pepperoni is your favorite pizza?”

“Yeah, it is.”

Yeowl.

Shaloonya appeared from behind a cabinet.

“Oh, what?” he said, looking down. “Oh, here.” He picked something invisible off his shoe. “A Screamer got away from us,” he said with a chuckle. “Not the first time.” He put the Screamer away in a box. “There.”

He patted Shaloonya who then disappeared. “Well, there is a story behind this shop.” He took a big bite of pizza, eating right out of the box.

“Yeah?” she said, helping herself to a slice while Tache slid up into her lap to check the pizza out. He whacked his approval, hoping for a bite.

“We are sitting right beneath our enemy.” He tried to sound dramatic. “The guys who were chasing us.”

“Ahuh.” She bit into the cheese stuffed crust, ignoring his dramatics.

“This is where they moved because of Tache,” he said, looking like he wanted more of a reaction out of her.

Tache popped his head up, dangerously close to her piece of pizza.

“Yes, you,” Garon said, pointing a finger at Tache who didn’t even blink an eye. “I know when they’re around or not. I pretty much control this building. Let me just say there are lots of spiders and other things creeping around up there.”

“So we’re pretty safe here, huh?” She focused on her pizza.

“I would say so,” he said, pausing to chew and swallow. “There are so many scanners and deactivators over our head that they couldn’t detect us even if they knew we were here. Now that they’ve moved, this is the safest place we can be.” He finished his first slice and dove into his second slice of pizza.

“Huh, I guess,” she said, grabbing another slice, but she really thought this was so neat and exciting. The metal slivers, plastic bits, and all the other things stuffed onto shelves and into cabinets were getting more and more interesting. There were so many cabinets…

“Where am I sleeping tonight? Not on the floor, I hope.” She pretended to be sore.

“No floor,” he said in between bites. “Done?”

She grabbed one more slice. “Now I am.”

He slid the leftover pizza into the frig.

“Over here,” he said, pointing around another cabinet, showing her a nook with a cot. “And over here…” He pointed out a normal wood door leading to a restroom with one toilet and a sink. There was no shower or tub, and only paper towels.

“Is there enough food for both Tache and Shaloonya?” she said.

“Oh, yes. Over here.” He led her around another cabinet.

“The Waterer like at grandma’s office,” she said, pointing out the familiar six-legged stool like spider.

“No, it’s an automatic food bowl filler,” he said. “As soon as the food bowl becomes too light, see it’s on a small scale, the spider fills it up again. And over here is the ever-flowing Tail water fountain.”

In one corner, connected to a pipe, was a fountain.

“If it gets too low, it automatically refills,” he said.

Tache trotted over and batted at the water bubbling up. He shook his paw, sending water flying.

“Tache, don’’t,” she said, waving him off.

“Oh, don’t worry about that.” He gestured, looking unconcerned, toward a rag sitting by the fountain.

“What? Tache’s gonna to wipe up after himself,” she said, laughing.

The rag moved, startling both she and Tache as it zigzagged around the water fountain, soaking up the water. Tache pounced, missing as the rag avoided him. The rag returned to its spot by the fountain. Tache batted at it, but it buzzed at him, flapping away his paw.

“Tache, leave it alone,” she said with a laugh. “A rag spider. What, no dust spider?”

“Dust spider?” Garon said, looking confused.

“To dust the shelves, of course,” she said.

“Oh, never thought of that. I have the Rag because Shaloonya, and I see Tache as well, likes to play in the water. Gets all over the floor.” He pulled out a pillow from a cabinet and threw it on her cot. “The Ball is in two more days. We have a couple of other things to work on. Then we have to work on you.”

“Me?”

“Yes. On the day of the Ball, your grandma has arranged for you to be beautified. Hairstylist and beautician I think are the terms. We will have to meet them in a place that I hope is safe (your grandma’s house).”

“Cool,” she said, feeling the excitement that she really was going to the Ball.

“Now, you get some rest. Tomorrow we have a lot of work to do. Good night.” He disappeared around another cabinet.

“Good night.” She heard the creak of another cot.

With relief, she found the cot was comfortable. Tache joined her, putting his head on her chest. She wondered if she could sleep.

Paxine’s hand slid down Tache’s side when she fell asleep. Tache rose, joining Shaloonya out by the table.

The table was clear except for two Screamers. He nosed one and it crawled towards him and up on to his fur. He flattened his ears. Its screaming was annoying.

Shaloonya nosed the other, letting it crawl on her before leading Tache to a small cat-sized door up above a cabinet. The door opened out on top of a pipe that followed the corridor. The utility lights lit the corridor below. Nothing stirred, but it wasn’t silent to Tache and Shaloonya with the two Screamers.

Shaloonya moved along the pipe until it curved. There she jumped down, activating a sliding door that opened out to a parking garage. She crossed through the garage toward the street.

There was no moon and the streetlights were gritty and dim. The parking garage appeared deserted, making it easy to stay undetected. Tache liked that, letting his tail whip and flick at will, until he found that Shaloonya was leading him toward a busier street a couple of blocks away.

He didn’t like the looks of the busy street. No one was out walking at this time of night, but there were still a lot of cars. He would rather have had the people.

Shaloonya settled in a shadowy niche of a building by a busy corner, looking like she was going to sit there forever.

Tache’s tail twitched. He couldn’t fit into the niche with Shaloonya even if he wanted to. Instead, he kept in the shadow of a No Parking sign. Why were they waiting?

Screamer screaming.

He didn’t know the whole plan. Shaloonya wouldn’t tell him everything. His tail whipped across the sidewalk.

Glaring eyes.

Shaloonya’s message was clear. They were on a mission, and if he messed it up… She puffed herself up. Tache sat on his tail, worried.

A scooter pulled up to the corner. A woman got off, removing a box. A side flap opened. The woman stretched, turning her back away from the box. The light changed and she strapping the box back on.

Tache didn’t like the box, sitting this close to Shaloonya. Her fur tickled his nose, and she kept standing on his tail. The box bumped and he slid into her.

Grrr

He tried to shrink against the opposite side, but there was little room.

Bump

Grrr

Screaming

The box was hot. Shaloonya threatened to bite off his twitching tail.

Bump

Grrrr

Screaming

Tache pulled his tail underneath him, scrunching into as tight of a ball as he could. It was getting hotter.

Grrr

Screaming.

The scooter stopped. Tache hoped it wasn’t a traffic light stop. The scooter moved, but…

The flap lifted with a rush of cool air.

“One hour,” the woman said in a low voice.

Tache flew out of the box as if his tail was on fire, stopping only under cover of the bushes. The woman drove off. He hoped Shaloonya was still in the box, but she wasn’t, passing him in the bushes.

Two houses down, Shaloonya stopped, taking cover under some low bushes. A tall wrought iron fence with a gate across the driveway surrounded the house that seemed to interest her. The fence was of no concern to them, having cat wide spacing between the bars. However, the short cut grass offered little cover until the line of bushes heading to a garden patio.

A guard appeared, coming around the house, down the driveway. Tache knew this was his cue before Shaloonya could remind him. He dashed between the fence bars, keeping as low as he could go, knowing he was in full sight until he reached the shrubs around the garden patio. The guard showed no sign of seeing him, showing no sign that he was paying attention to anything, jingling his keys as if he was out for an evening stroll.

Low flowering bushes, edging the house, provided enough cover for Tache to get close to the guard. He shook off his Screamer, sending it out into the lawn. His tail smacked the bushes.

The guard’s flashlight swept across the bushes when he stepped into the grass.

“Chirp,” Tache said, imitating the sparrows he had seen out a window the other day.

“Bird in hand is worth two in the bush. That doesn’t make sense. Why would I want two in the bush?” the guard said, muttering to himself as he turned off his flashlight.

Tache felt his whole body quiver with excitement. He had completed his mission. Why the guard needed a Screamer, he didn’t know. He didn’t understand Shaloonya’s explanation about getting the dog out of the way. What dog?

The guard scanned the front lawn, then turned around, retracing his steps around the house. He jiggled the handle to the back door, checking the lock.

“Woof.” A large dog jumped at the glass on the door.

“Easy boy,” the guard said.

“Woof. Woof. Woooooof.”

“Dumb dog,” a man’s voice said, yelling from within the house. “It’s just the guard.”

“Woof.” The dog sounded irritated.

“Shut up,” the man said again.

“Woof. Woof.”

“Then go out, dumb dog,” the man said, opening the door.

The dog bounded out, racing toward the guard.

“Easy boy. Haha. I got your treat, but you need to wait til morning,” the guard said, putting his hands out as if commanding the dog to stand down.

The dog lunged with bared teeth.

“Nooo. Git off. Ahhhh. NO,” the guard said, yelling at the dog, trying to keep the gnashing teeth away.

Shaloonya moved up beside Tache. He followed her when she moved closer to the back door.

“What’s got into that dog?” the man said, appearing at the door. He was in pajamas, holding a glass of milk.

“Help, here. We need some help here,” the pajama man said, calling back into the house.

“Help. Git off. Ow ow,” the guard said, screaming at the dog now latched onto his arm.

Another guard, holding a cup of coffee, ran out of the back door to help. “What’s...” His coffee flew to the ground as he raced toward the dog.

Snarl. The dog gave warning to the second guard but didn’t let go of the first.

“Git him off. Arg. Git him…aaarg,” the first guard said, getting more frantic as the dog tightened his grip.

“Sitz. Platz. Hier. Get off him you damn dog,” the second guard said, yelling at the dog as he tugged on the dog’s collar, using the German commands the dog should have obeyed. The dog ignored him.

The pajama man opened the door to go back inside as if thinking the two guards could handle the dog.

“Aaaaaah,” the first guard said, screaming, sounding even more desperate. The scream echoed through the neighborhood.

The glass of milk flew against the house when the pajama man raced to help.

For the split second that the door hung open, Shaloonya dashed inside the house.

Milk dripped off the siding. Tache licked his lips.

“Platz. Platz,” the second guard said, pulling as hard as he could on the dog’s collar. “Sitz. Platz. Hier.” He heaved his whole body back, twisting the collar, managing to disengage the dog from the first guard.

“What’s wrong with that dog? Get that man to a hospital. Oh, my…blood….The car. Get that dog in the house,” the pajama man said, half holding, half dragging the first guard toward the garage.

The second guard tugged the dog toward the house. Tache tensed. Shaloonya wasn’t out yet.

The dog lunged, almost freeing himself, trying to follow the first guard.

“I don’t know if I can hold him,” the second guard said with a grunt.

“No. No. No,” the first guard said, kicking his feet wildly to place more distance between him and the dog. His kicking unbalanced pajama man, who fell on top of him.

“Stop it. You’re getting blood on me. I got to get you to the garage. Get into the car,” the pajama man said at the top of his voice.

The second guard with the dog was losing ground as the dog dragged him closer to the garage, even after the first guard disappeared into the garage. The overhead door opened.

The second guard found it easier to guide the dog toward the entry door of the garage, away from the overhead.

The car pulled out and the overhead door closed. The guard released the dog into the garage, closing the entry door.

“What’s going on?” a woman said, standing at the door. She wore a pink frilly robe.

“Dog attacked…” the second guard said, getting into the car.

“What?” she said at the top of her lungs in a demanding tone of voice.

The driver’s window opened.

“The guard is dying. Got to get to hospital. Damn dog attacked,” the pajama man said.

“What dog?” the woman said, screaming back.

“The guard dog, you idio…” the pajama man said, closing the window.

The garage overhead door rattled as the dog lunged against it. The car screeched down the driveway.

The woman leaned out from the door to watch the car go, and Shaloonya slipped by.

“Hey, why is there milk all over my rose bushes?” the woman said.

Tache and Shaloonya flashed across the lawn, back to the bushes beside the road. The gate to the driveway clanged shut. The neighborhood fell quiet again.

A scooter coasted down the street, stopping near the driveway.
