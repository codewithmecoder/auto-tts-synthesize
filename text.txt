“I had a really weird dream last night,” Paxine said, heading to the bathroom to brush her teeth.

Garon put the leftover pizza out on the table. “Good morning. We have a busy, busy day.”

“I was riding in a box on the back of a scooter. And I remember spiders,” she said, grabbing a brand new toothbrush she found in the bathroom.

She had the feeling that Garon wasn’t listening or at least didn’t seem interested, grabbing a piece of pizza and eating over the box.

“This is my kind of breakfast. Soda too?” she said, deciding to eat first and brush later.

“Unwess you want to dwink out of the cat fountain,” he said with his mouth full.

“Ha ha.” She grabbed two sodas from the fridge.

“I don’t know why Tache is so tired. He slept with me all night,” she said, finding glasses and ice. “He’s curled up so tight in a ball on my bed I don’t think I could uncurl him.”

“Let him sleep. We don’t need any of his services at the moment.”

They finished the last of the pizza and he threw the box away.

“Go get your new shoes,” he said, pushing the table over to one side of the room.

“Why?” She brushed crumbs from her shirt.

“Practice,” he said.

“Let me brush first.” She chugged the rest of her soda, burping as she headed into the bathroom to brush her teeth and wash her face.

Garon seemed to be dancing around the room when she came back through to get her shoes. What was he going to do? Teach her to dance? She unboxed her new shoes, releasing new shoe scent into the room. The shoes sparkled, looking magical. She had never been excited about shoes before.

“Come around here. Pretend that this is the entrance to the Ball. Security will be here and here.” He pointed as if there were tables and barricades positioned around the room.

Paxine slipped her shoes on, feeling as if she was walking on stilts. She wondered if she could pretend to be an adult and get her own cube. How much did they cost? How much money did the cash card that Garon gave her have left?

“Watch it. That’s security. Stay with me now,” he said, leading her around the invisible objects. “This is how you present your invitation, then they will have you go into a cube that goes to the Ball. Then there is more security…” He led her through the routine, pretending to show the invitation, entering a cube, and exiting the cube.

Paxine rolled her eyes behind his back.

“Now, about what to say. Try and always divert the conversation back to the person. Ask them questions. Compliment them. If they ask you a question, answer briefly, and then ask them back. Keep them talking is the goal. The more they talk, the less you have to talk.

“I think I can handle that. So how long have you been skirting around security?” she said.

“What security? Okay, now put your arm through mine. Stand tall and act like you are better than anyone,” he said, ignoring her joking without missing a beat.

She giggled.

“I’m serious,” he said.

“I’m laughing about ‘what security’.”

“Well, you’ve seen security like the restaurant,” he said matter-of-fact.

“Yeah. What security.” She did a dramatic eye roll.

“Okay. Nose up. That is how these people walk. Give people a thin-lipped smile and maybe a nod of the head or just a slow blink of the eyes. Or better yet, pretend you are the Queen of cats, and everyone is your servant.” He stuck his nose up in the air.

Paxine stuck her nose high in the air, pretending to be haughty.

“Excellent,” he said, looking delighted. “Keep that up and I’d not even recognize you, which is good actually. Hopefully no one else will recognize you either.”

“I’ve never really met any of these people. I’ve only seen them on the news. Dad’s press conferences never include mom or me.”

“Yes, on purpose. Now let’s pretend to talk.”

He led her arm in arm around the room, pretending the cabinets were people.

“How do you do,” he said, introducing her to a cabinet, showing her how to act and talk. “Now you do it.”

“I happen to know this cabinet,” she said. “But I will introduce you to this cabinet. How do you do?”

Garon ignored her playing, making her repeat the conversations until he was satisfied.

“Now remember, if they get too nosey about who you are, ask them how well they know the governor or something like that,” he said, pulling plastic pieces and tools from cabinets.

“This is how the table is set. Your plate. Salad plate. There will be 3 forks and three spoons,” he said.

“I’ve already learned the fork and spoon rules. You do know who I am,” she said with a glare.

“Oh, right. I forgot. You’re not totally isolated from high society.”

He set the table using plastic pieces for plates and tools for silverware. She found it hard to take the settings seriously with screwdrivers and pliers pretending to be forks.

“Now, there won’t be any seafood, shell fish, peanuts or cheese,” he said, rattling off items as he counted on his fingers.

“No cheese? Why?”

“The Governor is allergic to peanuts, someone, uh, I can never remember, is allergic to shell fish. And they like to stay away from dairy. Urg.” He scratched his head. “Nobody seems to eat just plain food. Have to have fancy stuff and everyone is allergic to stuff.”

“Crepes. Stuffed olives. Pate and caviar,” She said with a snobbish tone.

“Now stay away from pate and caviar. Try to eat what is real food,” he said.

“And what is real food?” she said, looking at the fake plates and silverware.

“Salads without dressing. Breads. No butter. Vegetables that are not in a sauce,” he said using his fingers again to rattle off the items.

“I see. Don’t eat anything,” she said.

“Your Tail won’t be able to check what you eat so…ahhh, yeah, don’t eat anything. Or wait for someone else to eat it first. And especially, don’t eat anything you don’t recognize,” he said, looking horrified that anything edible could be unrecognizable.

He sat, pretending to eat.

“Can I talk?” she said, sitting next to him.

“What? Of course not. What did I say? Have everyone else talk. You listen. Listen to whoever is talking as if they are the most interesting person you have ever met,” he said, rising. “Now let’s go through security again. Walking to your table and …”

“This is the hundredth time we’ve done this,” she said hours later. “How about some real food?”

“Huh?” He checked the time. “Oh, dear! You’re right. We missed lunch. Chinese okay?”

He headed for the door without waiting for an answer.

“Mai Fun if they have it,” she said, wondering where he was going to find a Chinese restaurant.

He nodded and was gone.

The shop was quiet. Tache was still sleeping. She pulled out her gamer, her stomach growling.

“Lunch. I mean dinner,” Garon said, coming through the door with a Chinese takeout sack.

“What?” she said in astonishment. She wasn’t even half way through a game. “That didn’t take long. Boy, I’m hungry. Where are the chopsticks?”

“Nope,” he said, setting the food on the table. “Now let’s go through security.”

“Food,” she said, looking like she was going to start drooling.

“In time.” He walked her through how to act going through security and going to her table. He pushed aside the fake plates and silverware and replaced them with plastic forks and the Chinese takeout.

“No chopsticks.” She resigned herself to following his instructions, figuring she would never get to eat if she didn’t.

Tache and Shaloonya made a brief appearance to check the food, before disappearing again. She wondered if Shaloonya was still training Tache.

“Okay, enough practice, let me show you a film of last year’s Ball,” he said, finishing a plate of Mai Fun.

Paxine shoveled in the last of the rice while Garon set up a screen. The film was short, showing people lining up, presenting their invitation and disappearing into a cube. She almost fell asleep watching.

“Now that you’ve seen how it’s done, let’s practice again,” he said.

“I know how to do this.” She yawned.

“You need to know how to do this in your sleep. There is no second chance when we’re actually there.”

She sighed, but knew he wouldn’t let her rest until she was perfect. After two more rehearsals, he was satisfied.

“Now, how do we hide it?” he said

“Hide what?” she said, thinking it was bedtime.

“The spoon.”

“Why do I need the spoon?”

“You should always be armed. You’re not getting through security with a club or a gun. But no one is going to take the spoon away,” he said.

“Oh.” She thought a spoon would be rather conspicuous, but she pulled the spoon out of her backpack. “It’s kinda long.”

“Hum.”He examined the spoon with great care.

“In my hair?” She pulled her hair up into a bun and tried to stick the spoon in it.

He shook his head no.

“Well, I can’t stick it in a boot. I won’t have a purse large enough. Can’t take the backpack.”

There was no place to hide the spoon, so why was Garon still thinking? She didn’t see an end to his thinking so decided she had to show him there was no place for the spoon.

“I’ll go put the dress on,” she said.

Paxine felt like a princess. The dress floated around her like wisps of blue smoke.

“There isn’t a belt or sash,” she said, dancing around the room. “I can’t hide it under the dress unless I strap it to my leg, but…”

She slipped the spoon under her dress.

“Too long,” he said. “And not handy.”

“Well, then…” She slipped the spoon; handle first, down the front of her dress.

“Hum.” He didn’t look happy.

Paxine checked a mirror. The spoon looked ridiculous. “Well, maybe a necklace that goes down low. Or…”

“Sparkles,” he said, grabbing a pair of scissors from a drawer.

“Sparkles?” She wondered why he was heading for her with the scissors.

“Hold still.” He snipped a few sequins off her dress.

“You’ll ruin the dress,” she said, moving away.

“Only a few and they won’t be missed. Now, give me the spoon.”

He embedded the sequins into the rounded end of the spoon.

“Almost,” he said, snipping off more sequins and embedding them into the spoon. “One more…”

“No. That’s enough.” She moved out of his reach. “People are wearing stranger things.”

“Just a few more…” He was holding the scissors, looking like a dangerous maniac to her.

Paxine escaped to her cot, returning the dress to the safety of the plastic.

“We’re not done yet,” he said.

“Really.” She stomped into the room. “I’m getting really tired.”

“One more time.”

Paxine sighed, resuming her character, walking through security and dining. However, only after she completed an excellent conversation with a shelf did Garon announced it was bedtime. She sunk down on her cot, falling asleep in moments.

However, it felt like no time at all when she hear Garon.

“Are you getting out of bed? It’s late. We gotta go,” he said, sounding as if she had slept the whole day.

“Already?” She rolled over on the cot to go back to sleep.

He whipped the blanket off her.

Paxine sat up with a groan, only to plop back down. Tache jumped up beside her, smacking her with his tail. “Okay. Okay,” she said, rising.

“Quickly now. We have to go.” He was rushing around, putting his worktable back in to the middle of the room.

“Can I go to the bathroom at least?” she said.

“Quickly.”

Garon was holding her new shoes and dress when she came out. She hoisted up her backpack, glad it was much lighter without Tache, who insisted on following Shaloonya, literally, copying whatever she did.

Crunch. The walk back through the corridors seemed just as long as the first time, if not longer. The debris underfoot crunched louder than she remembered.

Yawn.

She almost laughed when she caught herself walking with her nose in the air as if she was still practicing with Garon.

“You kept me up too late,” she said.

Creak.

He checked out the door before ushering her out. The sun was bright. She covered her eyes, using Tache’s eyes to guide her.

“It’s too early to be up,” she said with a moan.

“It’s already nine o’clock and we’re late.”

“Nine? Feels more like five,” Paxine said, having to use her own eyes. All she could see through Tache’s eyes was Shaloonya.

“Where we going? Where’s the car? I thought we’re going to grandma’s?”

“We are. No car today and no cube landings in this part of town,” he said, crossing the street.

“Why?” She noticed they weren’t going in circles this time.

“No tower,” he said.

“No what?”

Paxine didn’t get an answer, having to walk quickly to keep up with Him. He seemed focused on reaching their destination, wherever that was. She feared they were going to walk the entire way to her grandma’s house, which she knew was nowhere near the area of town they were in.

The apartment buildings disappeared behind them and small businesses and warehouses now surrounded them. Paxine yawned, thinking this area didn’t look any more promising than the apartment buildings for a cube landing. The buildings were dreary and no one was around.

“How many more miles?” she said, feeling tired and hungry. She yawned again.

Ding.

A short distance ahead a cube appeared.

Greta stepped out. “Good morning sleepy head,” she said with a laugh.

“What a sight for sore feet,” Garon said, sounding tired.

Paxine pretended to sleep walk, raising her arms, shuffling into the cube. She yawned again, feeling herself propelled into her grandma’s living room.

“Good morning,” her grandma said, giving her a hug. “Ugh. You need a shower.”

“Good morning grandma,” Paxine said, dropping her backpack with relief, yawning again.

“Goodness, Garon. You wore her out,” her grandma said.

“What’s for breakfast?” he said, ignoring the comment.

“First, a shower for this young lady. What about you?” her grandma said.

Garon pretended to sniff his shirt.

“Meow.”

“Who asked you?” he said, pretending to glare at Shaloonya, but only for a moment. “Yes, I guess I need a shower, too.”

“Upstairs, both of you,” her grandma said with a commanding glare.

Paxine thought her grandma’s stairs seemed steeper than usual. The bed in the guest bedroom looked inviting, but her grandma was right behind her, steering her toward the bathroom.

“Put all your clothes in the basket. Wash your hair,” her grandma said, barking out orders.

Her grandma turned the shower on, testing the water temperature.

“Water’s hot. Here’s a toothbrush for you. Make sure you brush well, you are going to a party tonight.”

“Aye aye captain,” Paxine said with a salute.

Her grandma shut the door. “And hurry up.”

Paxine thought a shower never felt so good. Her hair felt so grubby that she lathered it up twice. When she stepped out of the shower, her clothes were gone, but a robe hung on the door.

“You done?” her grandma said from outside the door.

“Yeah.” She wrapped her hair in another towel.

Her grandma opened the door. “Steamy in here. Come on down to the kitchen. You’ll be getting your hair and makeup done before you get dressed for the Ball.”

“That’s hours away,” she said.

“You’ll be surprised at how much time it takes to get ready. Breakfast is waiting.” Her grandma gave her a gentle push toward the stairs.

The kitchen was empty, but toast and a covered plate was on the table. Paxine slathered strawberry jam on her toast. She uncovered the plate, revealing a yummy omelet with ham, tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms; all the stuff she liked.

Garon danced into the kitchen. “Fresh as a flower. I just had a shower.” He gasped when he spied the teapot. “Ah, tea.” He shook like a man in need while he poured, but he never spilled a drop, tossing in two sugars and a good bit of cream. “Aaaah. Your grandma has the best tea.”

“Ha ha,” she said with a laugh.

Garon prepared a second cup when Shaloonya trotted into the kitchen, rubbing against him. He knelt to stroke her fur and give her chin a scratch before she trotted out of the room.

“She checks on you,” she said.

“Does Tache check on you?” he said.

“Yeah, he does. I guess I’m still getting used to everyone having cats.”

“Tails. And not everyone has them. Some, we are learning, are special.” He poured his third cup of tea.

“Like Tache and how he protected someone else?” she said.

“Yes, and Tinder and Shaloonya.” He paused to spread strawberry jam on his toast, and take a bite.

“Hum?” She prompted him to continue.

“We think Tinder and Shaloonya are sisters. They came from the same breeder, but not the same litter. Shaloonya is older,” he said, wiping a smudge of jam from his finger.

“I thought Shaloonya was Tinder the first time I saw her. They have the same face and eyes. Mainly the eyes,” she said.

Garon ate some more toast before he continued. “They can talk to each other.”

“So. Tache talks to Tinder whenever they see each other,” she said with a shrug.

“No, I mean they can talk to each other even when not together.”

“That’s telepathy and impossible,” she said matter-of-fact.

“Hum, Tails tend to do that. The impossible. Your grandma and I realized after she got Tinder. It makes it easier for her and me to exchange information. Through the Tails,” Garon said.

Paxine’s toast stopped half way to her mouth. “So that’s how you’ve… Is that how you were ordering dinner? Pizza? Chinese? You never called and were back so soon.”

“Yep.” He finished his toast, uncovering his own plate of omelet.

“We have a busy day,” her grandma said, coming into the kitchen. “Come along. Time for your manicure, young lady.” She was holding her own nails out while they dried.

The sofas were pushed against the walls to accommodate the chairs and tables needed by the beauticians. A woman wearing a pink smock was waiting. The table by her was full of clippers, files, polish, and cotton balls.

“Have a seat. Let me see your hands,” said the woman.

Paxine thought for sure her nails were going to fall off. The woman trimmed, filed, buffed, soaked and glued on new nails. She had never had this much done to her nails, ever. Her first coat of polish was drying; Tache strolled in and tickled her legs with his tail.

“Don’t,” she said with a giggle. “I can’t pet you. My nails are wet.”

Tache threaded through her legs one last time and trotted off with a sorrowful meow, only to tackle Tinder passing by to check on her grandma. They wrestled until Tache broke off, racing away with Tinder in hot pursuit.

Paxine laughed, and it proved to be her only entertainment for the hour. Tache made another appearance when the manicurist finished.

“You’re next,” the woman said, picking up some nail clippers. She didn’t look like she liked cats. Tache fled the room. “All done. Let the nails dry for twenty minutes before you do anything.”

The manicurist packed her tools and left, replaced by the beautician. With nothing to do while her grandma got her hair done, Paxine snoozed on the sofa.

“Paxine. You’re next,” her grandma said.

“All ready?” She felt like she just closed her eyes.

She couldn’t snooze while her hair was trimmed. It was boring to sit there. Tache and Shaloonya raced in to check things out.

“Out,” her grandma said, louder than normal. “I don’t want hair tracked all over this house.”

The two Tails disappeared faster than a cube.

“Okay, missy,” the beautician said, putting in one more pin.

Paxine felt like there were weights pulling her hair. The curlers were uncomfortable.

“Here’s your gamer,” her grandma said, plopping a pillow on the sofa for her. “Just be careful of the nails.”

The gamer was harder to play with her fake nails. Paxine was just getting the hang of it…

“Time to take the curlers out,” the beautician said.

“Finally. I think my scalp is getting pulled out,” Paxine said.

The almost constant spritzing of hairspray dampened her relief to get rid of the curlers. It was like getting her hair glued in place.

“Take a look,” the beautician said, handing her a mirror, while she held a mirror behind so Paxine could see front and back. Her hair was styled into an elegant bun. Not a hair was out of place.

“Wow,” she said, certain her hair sparkled.

“There’s some lunch in the kitchen,” her grandma said, heading upstairs.

Paxine found a sandwich, taking it out to the patio. Tache was sleeping in the sun. She poked him, but he didn’t move. He needed his sleep, so she left him undisturbed, finishing her sandwich. She returned to the kitchen to drop off her plate.

“You’ll have to walk,” her grandma said to Garon. “Oh, Paxine. You might as well listen in. These are the plans for tonight.”

Paxine joined her grandma and Garon at the table.

“You’ll have to walk from the house. You can’t catch a taxi here. Go over to Market Square and catch a taxi there to the back of the Gala parking area. There you can take the public cube to the Gala,” her grandma said.

“What’s wrong with a cube? I don’t like cars,” Paxine said with a moan.

“No cubes,” Garon said.

“So then why can’t we catch the taxi here? Why not take the taxi to the Ball?” she said, wondering why a direct route wasn’t the best route.

“You can’t be seen coming from here,” her grandma said. “You can’t be associated with me in any way. Because of security, you can’t go directly to the Gala. You have to go to the parking area and take a cube from there. If you have private cubes you have to go to another area and then take a public cube from there.”

“That is confusing,” she said, thinking people had a weird idea of security, just like the restaurant.

“All in the name of security,” Garon said, seeming to know what she was thinking. “So, we walk, get a taxi, and then walk some more to a cube. Got it.”

A woman popped her head into the kitchen.

“Oh,” her grandma said, jumping up. “Paxine. Off you go. Time for makeup.”

“What? I’m tired of this and I haven’t even gone anywhere. How does my mom do this?” she said, trudging into the living room.

Mud. Plaster. A spatula. Paxine’s skin felt smothered with makeup. Black gook hung from her eyelids. Her lips felt coated in rubber. Even her eyebrows felt heavy as if they would pull her skin over her eyes.

“Take a look,” said the woman.

Paxine didn’t recognize herself. There was no mud or plaster. There was no black gook handing from her eyelids. It just felt like it. She looked like a model and it wasn’t her own face she saw.

“Marietta will help you get dressed,” her grandma said, calling from the kitchen.

“This is like a major production,” she said, whining.

“Paxine, you have no idea how big this is,” her grandma said with a stern voice, having heard her.

Paxine regretted her whining, heading upstairs with Marietta.

“Very pretty dress,” Marietta said in Portuguese, helping Paxine step into the dress so as not to mess her hair or makeup. Marietta zipped her up and fluffed out the skirt.

Paxine expected to be excited about the shoes and dress, but…this was business and she regretted that she was acting like a whiny child. She noticed her backpack on the floor, taking out the spoon. Marietta must have brought the backpack upstairs for her, she thought, slipping the spoon down the front of her dress.

Marietta gave her an odd look, but said nothing.

Paxine felt odd. The reflection she saw in the mirror showed a stranger with an odd-looking spoon sticking out of her dress. She felt like she stepped into a dream. But was this a good dream or a bad one?

Paxine took care to walk down the stairs to go to the kitchen. She still wasn’t use to the skirt or the shoes. There was a strange man in the kitchen.

“Wow,” Paxine said in total surprise, recognizing the man.

Garon was dressed in a black tuxedo, newly shaven and his hair combed. He stood straight and tall.

“Wow,” she said again.

Garon turned at her voice. “How do you do? And who may I ask are you?” He smiled and offered her his hand. “I’m Garon.”

“It’s Paxine,” she said with a roll of her eyes.

“Paxine? Why my great niece is named Paxine and I think she is around here somewhere.” He looked around as if another Paxine would appear.

Her grandma joined them in the kitchen. “Oh, my goodness. You are gorgeous,” her grandma said, stopping in her tracks and staring.

“Please introduce me to this beautiful lady,” Garon said, continuing to look very serious.

Her grandma responded in stride, “Why this is Ms. Paxine Cushing, your date for this evening.”

“Well, how do you do?” he said, taking and kissing her hand.

Paxine blushed.

“I don’t feel beautiful. I feel like someone plastered mud all over me,” she said.

Tache ran into the room, looked around and left. However, he was soon back, meowing as if he couldn’t find her.

“Tache, I’m right here,” she said.

Tache jumped as if startled, whipping his tail to spin around and dashing out of the room.

“I think he’s been sniffing too much catnip,” Garon said with a chuckle.

“I think you put him up to that,” her grandma said.

“Do I look that different?” She tried to find a mirror, even though she had seen herself upstairs.

“Dear, you look like a stunning young lady. Hold on one moment,” her grandma said, leaving the room.

“Are you sure you’re Paxine,” Garon said, staring at her like he suspected she was someone else.

“And just who would I be? Tache?” she said.

“Do you have a tail?” he said.

“Of course.” She had to struggle to keep a straight face, but they both broke out laughing at the same time.

“Here,” her grandma said, returning and handing her some rings.

Paxine was surprised to find that they fit.

“These were your mom’s when she was younger. It’s all play jewelry, but no one will notice,” her grandma said, holding out a necklace. “And this will help with the spoon. Garon, couldn’t you have found something less obtrusive?”

The necklace dropped around Paxine’s neck low enough to touch the spoon. Bangles hung from the necklace, disguising the spoon even more.

“I think it’s perfect,” Garon said with a wink to Paxine.

“Beautiful,” her grandma said, ignoring Garon. “Your own parents wouldn’t recognize you.”

“A good thing since she’s not supposed to be at the Ball,” he said.

“Garon. You should’ve left fifteen minutes ago. Hurry up. I have to go,” her grandma said, leaving in a hurry, slamming the door behind her.

“Do we have everything?” Garon kept checking his pockets.

“I’m dressed. I have my spoon. And Tache is raring to go,” she said, standing by the door.

Whack. Tache’s tail tried to dent the floor while he and Shaloonya waited.

“That’s it then. Hurry up,” Garon said.

Paxine shook her head at him. He was the one delaying them.

Tache and Shaloonya led the way the six blocks to Market Square. A taxi waited for them.

“We’re going to be awfully early,” she said.

Garon checked another pocket. “Not really,” he said, not explaining any more

Paxine thought he looked distracted and thought it wise not to ask for more of an explanation. In her head, she kept going over her training with him like a song she couldn’t get out of her head. There was how to get through the Gala Ball security, what to eat and what not to eat. She even ran through all of the self-defense moves he taught her. In between those thoughts, she kept wondering if she really knew what was going on?

Tache felt alert. Paxine knew he had been training with Shaloonya and he had developed the ability to focus. Both Tails sat on the floor of the taxi, out of sight of the driver.

The taxi crawled through the city. Paxine felt she could walk faster. The streets were crowded with traffic and people. She was sure she saw other people dressed in tuxedos and fancy dresses.

The taxi’s meter clicked away the time. An hour passed. She felt as if they had been riding forever but had only gone a few blocks. There were no cubes in sight. Why? Weren’t cubes faster?

The meter clicked to the two-hour mark and the driver turned into a huge parking lot. There was a long line of taxis ahead of them. Garon hummed as the taxi crept up the line.

“Here ya go sir. Miss,” the driver said, pulling the taxi up to the unloading zone.

Garon handed over payment. He fumbled over opening the door, taking some time getting out. Paxine felt exasperated with him until she realized he was giving Tache and Shaloonya the time to get out and disappear.

Their taxi pulled away and another took its place. Taxis stretched out of the parking lot and down the street.

Garon straightened his jacket. “Start—“

“I know,” she said, sticking her nose in the air and giving him a haughty glare.

Garon smiled, humming.

Everyone moved toward one end of the parking lot where there was a lineup. At the end of the lineup were two cubes. No three. No four. Paxine couldn’t count them. Cubes came and went too fast to count.

Most men wore tuxedos. She noted a few men wearing military uniforms. One man wore a white tuxedo with a red shirt. However, the dresses the women wore were extraordinary. The dresses came in every color, every length, and every width.

Tache wasn’t too far from her, hiding in the fluff of an older woman’s gown. The gown’s skirt fluffed out so much the woman’s husband couldn’t get close enough to hold her hand.

Even farther up the lineup, a woman with an elaborate shawl and purse shifted in the line. Her purse had legs. It was Shaloonya. She fit perfectly underneath the purse, partially hidden by the shawl.

Each time a cube left, everyone moved up two paces. Paxine concentrated to maintain her character, keeping her nose in the air. She was amazed at how many others were doing the same. With noses in the air, she knew no one was going to see Tache or Shaloonya.

The woman with Shaloonya left in a cube, and soon after that, the woman in the fluffy dress with Tache left. Paxine and Garon were next. A man checked their invitation and ushered them inside.

She felt like she was practicing with Garon all over again. The security setup was how he said it would be. They passed through the process without a hitch, entering the path leading to the ballroom.

Balls sparkled along the path, covered with a thin red carpet. Two men, dressed like butlers, opened double doors to the ballroom. A huge glittering ball hung on each side of the entrance. Paxine felt like she needed sunglasses. The ballroom was huge. Tables were set in the middle, decorated with centerpieces of orange bird-of-paradise flowers. A stage stood at the far end. Pale sheets of silk shimmered behind it. To one side was a small orchestra playing music. She knew the theme of the Gala Ball was about children, but the decorations supported a theme of money.

Garon kept to the edge of the room outside of the groupings of people. Paxine felt as if he was looking for someone. Tache was invisible, moving around the room.

A cat appeared from under a table, disappearing under another in the blink of an eye.

Who was that? There were other Tails here?

Tache complained.

“Tache says there’s a Screamer…” she said, careful to cover her mouth.

“Yes, I know,” Garon said between closed lips.

A moment later, Garon uttered a satisfying, “Ah.”

“Ah, what?” She looked about.

“The Portuguese ambassador, Adalberto Marques, and his wife, Cecilia. I do believe we should chat with him. Be sure to mention his daughter, Ana,” Garon said, approaching a small group of people. He smiled with the biggest smile he could.

“Boa noite, senhor,” Garon said with a perfect Brazilian accent, joining the group as if he knew them all. “A minha neta, Paxy.” He introduced her to the ambassador as his granddaughter.

Paxine didn’t know what to do. This wasn’t something they practiced. What was she supposed to ask about? The ambassador’s daughter?

She smiled. “Muito bom conhece-lo. Eu ouco sua filha…” (Very nice to meet you. I hear your daughter)

“Ana, minha filha,” the ambassador said, cutting her off, waving his hands in excitement.

Paxine remembered Garon’s teaching and remembered to listen as if the ambassador was the most interesting person in the world as he spoke about his daughter, who had just been accepted into the local medical college.

“Come. Come,” the ambassador said, changing to English. “You must join us at our table. You speak Portuguese well, but we must speak English while we are here.”

“Thank you. That would be an honor,” Garon said.

Tables were filling up, but the ambassador had his own table. They all sat just as waitstaff streamed out to serve salads.

Paxine stared at the plate of three wilted salad greens with an unidentifiable yellow vegetable sliver. What was that? Salad was a real food that Garon said she could eat, but…

The only salad dressing was orange and smelled odd. She wasn’t the only one who didn’t eat the salad.

The ambassador didn’t give the salad a second look, pushing it away, chatting with Garon. His wife also pushed the plate away, sitting reserved, smiling, and letting her husband talk. The other two couples at their table did the same.

The next course arrived. Paxine didn’t know what it was, leaving it untouched. She noted Garon ignored the food as if star struck with listening to the ambassador. The ambassador was entertaining, gesturing wildly as he told stories. His whole table remained quiet and listened.

Courses came and went. Paxine felt her stomach growl. Dessert arrived.

“What is dis?” the ambassador’s wife said, speaking the words that Paxine was thinking. Mrs. Marques poked at the tiny square of purple on the plate. There was the tiniest dollop of whip cream.

“Pouding de pamplemousse,” said the waitstaff.

The ambassador’s wife pushed aside the dish.

Grape pudding. Paxine didn’t think that sounded too appetizing and pushed her plate away as well. The other couples made faces and followed suit. She had the feeling no one at the table ate.

Paxine wondered if Garon planned to sit at the ambassador’s table. Hadn’t he been looking for someone? Or was this just a coincidence. No, she thought. Garon planned this. He had to have. They could both speak Portuguese and the ambassador had a daughter. Way too coincidental. So what else was planned that she didn’t know about?

A large man walked up onto the stage. He marched to the podium and the orchestra music faded.

“Good evening and welcome,” the man said with a deep voice that carried throughout the room, silencing everyone. “For those of you who don’t know who I am, I am Judge Elmer Schumauker. We would like to thank all of our sponsors for this event.”

Paxine thought the name was familiar. She applauded with everyone while the Judge mentioned the sponsors of the evening, but Paxine didn’t hear the names. Another cat passed between the tables, unseen by anyone but her. That was a Tail she didn’t know about. Whose?

Judge Schumauker’s voice changed. “Children who cannot be protected and cared for by their parents…”

That reminded her that her parents were somewhere here, but she hadn’t seen them.

“Even some of the most well-to-do parents, have problems with protecting their children…” Judge Schumauker said.

Paxine knew the judge meant her dad and she followed his eyes. Her dad and mom were at a table by themselves as if everyone was snubbing them. Her dad showed no indication that he knew that Judge Schumauker was talking about him.

“We have some special guests this evening…” Judge Schumauker said, waving off to the side of the room.

Along the edge of the room, came twelve children. They were poorly dressed and even their hair hadn’t been combed. Paxine couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Someone was trying to make people believe these were underprivileged children needing protection. She knew half of them. They went to her school. Then it occurred to her they were trying to make her dad look even worse by using children her own age.

Judge Schumauker ushered the children up on the stage. All of the children looked uncomfortable which only added to the image of poor children.

“This is the year of the child. Our theme for this year’s Gala is the value of our children. They need to be protected and nurtured,” Judge Schumauker said.

Paxine’s own feelings told her that she had to do something. She surprised herself, finding herself moving toward the stage, not even aware, she had stood up. No one questioned or stopped her. Perhaps they thought she was the next speaker. There was her grandma, but her grandma did nothing to stop her.

Judge Schumauker’s voice swept over her, but she didn’t hear his words, until…

“The Child Protection Act is important…” Judge Schumauker said.

“Excuse me,” Paxine said, taking the microphone out of his hand, causing him to back off in surprise.

“Good evening,” she said, facing everyone and feeling overwhelmed, but she knew what she wanted to say.

“I want to thank Judge Schumauker for his support of the Child Protection Act, but you are being misinformed,”she said, almost jumping at the sound of her own voice.

Judge Schumauker reached out for the microphone, but she backed away.

“Peter,” Paxine said. Her voice boomed throughout the room.

A boy in the middle jumped, looking guilty.

“This is Peter Framville. He’s a nephew of Judge Sampling who I see isn’t here tonight. Very convenient. Only the judge would recognize his own nephew. These children are here to represent poor and underprivileged children. I don’t think Peter is poor or underprivileged. He goes to Washington Secondary school.”

Judge Schumauker’s hand dropped to his side. He stared at Peter as if he had never seen him before and wondered where he came from.

“Chanti,” Paxine said.

A girl, first in line, turned as red as her hair.

“She also goes to Washington Secondary School. She’s the daughter of Betty Charcenter, the principal of Washington. Mrs. Charcenter isn’t in the political circles of this crowd so none of you may know her. I think Mrs. Charcenter would be aghast to see her daughter dressed this way.”

Chanti covered her face, looking like she wanted to faint.

A murmur rippled through the crowd and the faces were changing from amusement to disapproval.

“I think most of you would be embarrassed to support the Child Protection Act if you had actually read it. I have. On the fourth page, a single paragraph talks about the right to bear children. It means that the power to decide who can have children is in the hands of the government. If that happens, people like Judge Sampling would never be. He comes from a poor family of eight. He worked his way through college and is now a highly successful judge. Then there is Mr. Huntsboro.”

Mr. Huntsboro stood by a pretty woman who wasn’t his wife. His hand wasn’t where it should have been. He didn’t look appreciative of the sudden attention.

“You!” Patricia, his wife said, her heels clicking like pistons in an engine gaining speed.

Slap.

“You no good…” Patricia said, screaming at the top of her lungs.

Security dashed in to intervene before she slapped him again. A red slash spread across Mr. Huntsboro’s cheek from his wife’s diamond-encrusted wedding ring.

“Well, maybe Mr. Huntsboro isn’t a good example,” Paxine said.

The noise level of the room rose with murmurs, chairs creaking, and Patricia screaming.

Paxine brought the microphone closer. “He’s also from a poor family. His mother raised him and his two brothers…”

Someone stepped next to her.

“…alone,” Paxine said.

“You’re doing an excellent job. Keep going,” her grandma said in a whisper.

A shiver of excitement moved up Paxine’s spine. She felt strong, and she knew what she was doing. The room quieted now that Mrs. Huntsboro was gone.

“Many of our finest artists and musicians come from poor beginnings.” Everyone was looking at her. Not her grandma, who stood back, but her. “Last I heard there are hundreds of laws protecting children. Do we really need another one? Actually, I think we need a law that protects people from laws.”

A few people laughed.

“I should know. I’m Paxine Cushing. There have been numerous attempts against my life because my dad doesn’t support the Child Protection Act. I go to school with half these kids.” She waved a hand toward the children still on the stage. Chanti knees wobbled.

“I’m here tonight because sometimes the best way to protect something is to keep it right in plain sight. You may have heard that I was missing. Not only am I not missing, I know exactly where I am and where I stand. I stand with my parents who are firmly against this Act. The Child Protection Act is not about children, but about power.”

The entire hall turned toward her parents. There were a number of embarrassed faces. Her parents were standing, smiling at her.

“I too know where I stand, and I know where my daughter stands,” her dad said, nodding his approval to her.

Everyone stood there looking at her parents and then back at her. Paxine felt that she needed to wait to let the turn of events sink in before she concluded. Her dad winked at her. It was time to finish.

“I’m here to simply ask you to read the Child Protection Act before you support it. Thank you,” she said, almost feeling as if someone else spoke, but it was her voice and it was calm, containing a power she never knew was there.

The room was so quiet, Paxine could hear herself breathing. Then…

Applause.

A roar of applause.

“Watch who isn’t applauding,” her grandma said.

There were too many people to watch and Paxine didn’t know them all. Her parents were applauding. Mr. Huntsboro wasn’t applauding.

Judge Schumauker had the sense to usher the children off the stage. He handed them off to another person before disappearing.

Paxine made her way off the stage, her grandma following behind. Her parents and Garon met her at the bottom of the steps. However before a single word could be spoken, Patricia burst in. She was waving a gun and her face was ugly.

“You….you,” Patricia said, screaming.

No one moved.

Paxine wondered just for a moment how terrible security was.

“The Foundation is mine…” Patricia said to Paxine’s grandma with a scream, but her scream changed tones when a gray streak knocked the gun out of her hand. A brown streak raced between her feet, causing her to lose her balance, falling hard onto the floor, her breath knocked out of her with an unladylike grunt.

Her dad raised a hand and security surrounded them, securing the gun. Two security men helped Patricia up, keeping hold of her.

“NO,” Patricia said in a screeching voice. “You don’t understand. She’s retiring. It’s mine. Mine…”

Patricia fell against one of the security men holding her. “My shoe. You broke my shoe.” She tried to grab the high heel lying snapped off from her shoe, but the security guards prevented her.

“Get her out of here,” Paxine’s dad said with a wave of his hand.

Patricia limped off, refusing to take her shoe off

“You ruined my shoes. My shoes…” Patricia said, wailing and moaning. It was a relief when the door closed behind her, hushing her voice.

“Well,” her grandma said, watching Patricia go. “That explains that.”

“What do you mean?” Paxine said.

“She thought she could replace me,” her grandma said.

“But, she doesn’t have a Tail,” Paxine said.

“Exactly,” her grandma said, flashing her eyes around.

Paxine noticed some people moving through the crowd, following her grandma’s eyes, then her mom was hugging her tightly.

“When did you grow up,” her mom said, looking at her hard. “Mom, did you dress her up?”

“I bought the dress myself,” Paxine said with a smile. “Garon helped.”

“I just paid for it,” he said.

“She does have your tastes,” her grandma said.

“And you will be a great stateswoman,” her mom said.

“I agree,” her dad said.

“I think not.” The voice growled just loud enough for them to hear. Mr. Huntsboro was a few steps away, holding a bloody towel to his face. He had a gun.

So much for security, Paxine thought, with everyone having guns and Patricia providing the distraction. Everyone in the room still focused on the door Patricia exited with all the security personnel. Two men standing by that door were all that were left, and they couldn’t see what Mr. Huntsboro was up to.

“I’m not too pleased to have my background reported at such a public event. Or my popular Child Protection Act blasted out of existence by a mere child,” Mr. Huntsboro said, pointing the gun at her. “There is too much at stake. I think we’ll just move out of here nice and quiet.”

“I think not,” her grandma said, looking rather fierce, mimicking Mr. Huntsboro.

“I only need one shot to take out that which is dear to you all,” Mr. Huntsboro said, giving a short laugh as he bobbed the gun at Paxine to make his point.

“You have more to deal with than just us,” her grandma said.

“No damn cat is going to trip me up like my wife. Any cat comes near me and its dead,” Mr. Huntsboro said with a growl.

“It’s not THE cat, I would worry about. It’s the Tails,” her grandma said.

Even though it worked last time for Garon, Paxine still didn’t think it was smart to confuse someone pointing a gun at you.

Mr. Huntsboro laughed, motioning for them to move off.

Her grandma did move, but to step in front of Paxine. Her parents and Garon moved a step away. They were no longer a tight group.

“You don’t think I plan for things like this?” Mr. Huntsboro said, revealing a small pistol from beneath the towel. “You are idiots and so predictable.”

No one predicted Paxine stepping around her grandma with Tache’s wooden spoon in her hand.

“I would stay away from my grandma, if I were you,” Paxine said, pointing the spoon at Mr. Huntsboro.

Mr. Huntsboro laughed. “Just what are you planning on doing with that? Poison me with soup?”

“Disarm you,” Paxine said, furious with the mention of soup.

“You need to learn a few things little girl,” Mr. Huntsboro said with a swift kick that Paxine didn’t expect, sending the spoon flying from her hand.

“No…” Paxine said, ignoring the sting to her hand feeling like everything switched to slow motion, as the spoon flew through the air.

Tache appeared out of nowhere, flying, catching the spoon in mid-air. Then everything sped up when Tache landed, whipping his tail, spinning his whole body.

Bang.

Pop.

“No…” Paxine said, with a scream.

Mr. Huntsboro’s gun fired and a poof of black smoke encased him. Out of the black smoke dropped a gun.

“Yeow,” Mr. Huntsboro said, screaming. “What is this? It’s burning. Fire. I’m on fire.”

Another gun dropped out of the black smoke.

“Fire,” Mr. Huntsboro said as if calling for help, dropping to his knees.

A gray tail flashed past Mr. Huntsboro and the second gun spun away out of Mr. Huntsboro’s reach.

Paxine’s dad gave Mr. Huntsboro a hard kick to his back, knocking him over.

“I’m on fire,” Mr. Huntsboro said, pounding on his legs in desperation.

“Not for long,” Garon said, waving smoke out of his face, not looking too worried.

Her dad kicked away both guns to make sure they stayed out of reach.

Swoosh. A fire extinguisher doused Mr. Huntsboro and he looked like a fallen snowman.

“I’m burning. I’m burning. I’ll kill that cat,” Mr. Huntsboro said.

“I wouldn’t touch his legs,” Garon said.

“Don’t touch his legs. Chemical burn,” her dad said, directing the security men, who were running in from all directions.

“Oh, dear,” her grandma said sounding pained.

“Paxy, how’s your hand?” her dad said.

“It’s fine. What’s wrong Grandma?” Paxine said.

“Tinder,” her grandma said, looking at Garon. “Tinder has popper on her.”

Tinder limped up to her grandma. She mouthed mews of distress. Garon knelt, taking a bottle from his pocket. He poured it over the black popper goop that was burning her leg.

“That will neutralize it and keep it from spreading. She’ll have a bald patch for a while. The fur will fall out, but it will grow back,” Garon said.

Tears ran down her grandma’s face.

“She’ll be okay,” Garon said, pulling out a handkerchief from his breast pocket, putting his arm around her.

“She hurts,” her grandma said, dabbing at her tears taking care not to smear her makeup.

“Yes. It does hurt,” Garon said, holding her tight.

Paxine didn’t feel any pain, except for a little in her hand. Tache? Was he hurt? Shot? Dead? No, Garon said it hurt when your Tail died,,, Really hurt.

Clatter.

Tache emerged from under a table, dropping the spoon at her feet. He gave Tinder a comforting nose touch before disappearing back into the crowd.

“Paxy, how is your hand,” her dad said.

“It’s fine,” she said, relieved that Tache was alright.

Her dad pressed and poked her hand, moving all her fingers.

“Really. My hand is fine,” she said to reassure him.

“Nothing broken. Good,” her dad said, looking torn.

“We’re okay,” Garon said to her dad. “We have our own security. You go check on yours.”

Her dad gave a little smile and nod, leaving the group.

Paxine’s mom hugged her tight again. “You are grown up.”

“Thanks, Mom,” Paxine said with a smile, her eyes following her dad as he moved across the room. No one was snubbing him now. People stepped up to greet or acknowledge him warmly, now that his daughter was no longer missing and supposedly never had been.

Paxine thought how funny people could be. Did they think he would forget how they acted? Her dad was too smart for that. He remembered everything. She knew; she could never get away with anything twice.

A Tail crossed her dad’s path. His eyes followed it while no one else noticed. She expected him to frown, but he smiled.

Paxine realized her mom was crying.

“I’m fine mom, really,” Paxine said, finding that with her high-heeled shoes, she was almost as tall as her mom.

“I was so worried, even though I knew Tache was taking care of you,” her mom said, hugging her tighter.

“He did a good job,” she said, hugging her back, knowing that no one ever outgrew hugs.

“Best I’ve ever seen a Tail do,” her grandma said to them, but her eyes were looking over Garon’s shoulder.

A woman approached and there was a tail poking out from the folds of her long dress.

“This is JayLee, your new nanny,” her grandma said in introduction. Her grandma looked around. Only Garon and her mom stood near them. “Actually, Paxine, JayLee is your second cousin, but don’t tell your dad. And this is EJ, her Tail.”

“Hi,” Paxine said.

A spotted cat emerged. She was almost as large as Tache, but more of a sandier color. EJ was the other cat she had seen.

“She’s pretty,” Paxine said, offering a hand to EJ.

EJ just brushed Paxine’s hand with her nose, then retreated, curling her tail around Paxine’s hand.

“Mew,” EJ said, disappearing under a table.

“Where she going?” Paxine said.

“She has a job to do,” JayLee said. “She likes Tache.”

“That’s good,” Paxine said, laughing. “Especially, if we’ll be spending a lot of time together.”

“You okay?” JayLee said to her grandma.

“Tinder. Popper,” her grandma said.

JayLee nodded in understanding.

Judge Schumauker reappeared near the orchestra, motioning with his hands for them to play. He then waved to someone Paxine couldn’t see. Waitstaff appeared in a wave, offering trays of drinks.

Paxine didn’t know if Judge Schumauker was a good or bad person, but she did know she didn’t like him.

“Someone’s trying to make the best out of the remainder of the evening,” Garon said, noticing Judge Schumauker too.

“I think we still have a problem,” Paxine said, feeling Tache complaining about the noise, and he wasn’t meaning the music.

Her comment grabbed her grandma and mom‘s attention, but they turned to Garon not her.

“Hum,” Garon said, searching the crowd as if he was looking for someone.

“What do you mean?” her grandma said to Garon.

“Tache says there’s still a Screamer here. Isn’t Tinder complaining about it?” Paxine said.

Garon hummed, moving with the music.

“She’s distracted,” her grandma said with a sniff.

“Someone was directing Mr. Huntsboro,” Garon said through pursed lips.

A waitstaff slid in by her grandma’s shoulder, handing out glasses, seeming to know who should get what glass, since they all seemed different. Paxine sniffed, smiling. Soda. She figured the waitstaff was probably one of her grandma’s employees.

“How do you handle this when you are standing up and your Tail is off…guarding?” Paxine said, knowing from all her grandma’s and Garon’s training that she couldn’t drink from the glass.

“The duties can be shared,” her grandma said, kneeling with her glass.

Tinder stuck her head out from under her grandma’s dress, giving the glass a quick sniff and a mew of approval.

Paxine knelt, letting Tinder sniff her glass. Tinder mouthed her approval before ducking back under her grandma’s dress. Her grandma sniffed back a tear.

Paxine took a sip. Her favorite.

“Who was directing Mr. Huntsboro?” her grandma said, continuing the conversation as if checking drinks had never happened. “And where?”

“On stage,” Garon said, sipping his drink, staring at the Governor and his wife. They were stepping up onto the stage. “I thought we were bugging Huntsboro’s tuxedo, but it seems we caught someone else. No wonder we were caught off guard by him.”

Garon resumed humming and swaying to the music.

“Well, what are you going to do about it? What does this mean?” her grandma said.

“We don’t have enough information on the governor,” Garon said. “I do want to squash that Screamer before Shaloonya does. We can bug the governor another time.”

Her grandma seemed satisfied with this.

The governor, a heavy set man with thinning gray hair, took his wife’s hand to dance a waltz. No one else danced until the governor encouraged another couple with a wave of his hand. Both the governor and his wife had huge smiles on their faces as if they were having the time of their lives.

More and more couples joined the dance. The orchestra moved into its second waltz. The governor and his wife danced down the stairs of the stage to mingle with the other dancers.

“Come. Come. This is a Ball. I’m not leaving without a dance. Where is my beautiful date?” Garon said, putting out his hand for her.

Paxine was reluctant to put her glass down, realizing she couldn’t chug it, fearing she would never see the glass again. “I don’t know how to dance this type of dance.”

“Nonsense. Just watch my feet,” Garon said, speaking to the beat of the music and taking her glass, setting it on a table. “One, two, three. Move your feet. One, two three. Repeat, again, and one, two, three.”

Paxine found the dance step was simple. She laughed, finding after a few moments she could dance without watching his feet.

“One, two, three…spin….one, two, three,” Garon said, catching her off guard.

Paxine almost tripped, glad that Garon kept her at the edge of the other dancers so she didn’t stumble into anyone.

“One, two three…spin…one, two three,” Garon said.

Paxine giggled, thinking this was fun. And she always thought waltzing was an old people’s dance.

“One, two, three,” Garon said, spinning her into the crowd.

Paxine almost tripped, panicking as dancers surrounded her.

“One, two, three,” Garon said with a whisper. “You are doing great.”

Paxine focused on following his feet with the beat. Garon hummed, stepping perfectly with the music. She relaxed, feeling she was doing okay. And why not? The word was out on the Child Protection Act. The Huntsboros were heading to jail. She wasn’t missing anymore, so she could go home and…

Screaming.

Paxine felt jolted out of dream. There was still the annoying Screamer that was annoying Tache.

The governor and his wife danced in the middle of the dance floor. Everyone smiled at them. Garon stumbled.

“Oops,” Garon said.

“You okay?” Paxine said.

“Yep,” Garon said, but then he stumbled against another couple.

What was wrong with him? He was acting like he didn’t know how to…

“Oops, so sorry. Learning to dance,” Garon said to the couple with an apologetic smile.

The governor and his wife were not that far away.

“Now watch my feet. One, two, three,” Paxine said, understanding his intentions.

Garon laughed, tripping.

“Watch my feet. One, two, three,” Paxine said again, pretending to correct his movements.

The governor and his wife danced perfectly, still smiling as if they were having so much fun. They were a few dance steps away.

“One, two, three, spin,” Paxine said, feeling Garon trip against the governor.

Paxine felt instant relief from Tache.

“Oh, so sorry,” Garon said with a laugh, acting as if he had a few too many drinks. “She’s teaching me to dance and I’m all thumbs.”

Garon laughed again. “I mean left feet. I am all left feet.”

Paxine managed an apologetic smile, letting Garon waltz her away, exaggerating every step. He danced her out of the crowd, back to the edge of the dancers, where he was back to dancing perfectly.

Her grandma waved, smiling at them. A woman that Paxine didn’t know approached her grandma, whispering in her ear. Must be an employee, Paxine thought, seeing Tinder scooped up and taken away. Tache let her know that Tinder was heading to the vet.

Her grandma stood there alone, watching them dance. Garon kept dancing nearby. Then a woman approached her grandma. Then two more women approached. Garon danced Paxine further away. Before they were lost in the crowd, women surrounded her grandma, and more were coming. Paxine knew her grandma was regaining her control of the Foundation and the women it governed. She knew that one day, that was what she would do.

The waltz ended, but another began. Garon kept dancing. Paxine wondered if Garon planned his every step. It wasn’t coincidence that he took to the dance floor to squash the Screamer. The same for dancing near her grandma to make sure she was okay. She wondered what the next step was, but the waltz stopped.

Garon led her off the dance floor, almost colliding with....

“Oh Ambassador Marques. Senhora Marques,” Garon said in greeting. He bowed to the ambassador’s wife and she giggled. He offered his hand and swept her out onto the dance floor.

Paxine felt panic. What was she to do? Dance. “Danca?” she said to the ambassador.

The ambassador looked unsure, but then smiled.

Between the ambassador and Garon, Paxine danced all night. The crowd was thinning when she flopped onto a chair. “I’m tired and hungry.”

“Yas, may too,” a woman said, sitting beside her. She was one of the ambassador’s guests.

Garon flopped down on the other side of Paxine.

“So am I,” Garon said, patting his stomach. “Adalberto. We must dine together. A midnight snack is in order.”

“A snack? No. A meal. A feast. I so hungry,” Ambassador Marques said.

Garon slapped him on the back like an old friend. “Yes, good food. Good Portuguese food.”

The two men walked arm in arm toward the door.

Dawn was streaking the sky red when Paxine fell exhausted into bed at her grandma’s house. Somehow, Garon led them to a restaurant that was still open and served excellent Portuguese food. Her belly was full.

Yawn.

The house was secure and all was quiet. Tache curled up close to her.

“Thank you, Tache,” she said, scratching his chin. A rumble of a purr, the first she had ever heard, vibrated through his whole body.

“Paxine?”

Paxine felt like she’d just gone to sleep.

“Paxine,” her grandma said, putting her hand on her shoulder.

“What?” she said, checking the clock. “Nine o’clock. Can I sleep another hour?”

“Sorry to wake you, but we have some business to attend to,” her grandma said.

“But…but it’s Sunday,” Paxine said, having a hard time keeping her eyes open. Tache was a motionless slug beside her.

“Yes, but our business never stops. Throw on some jeans, nothing fancy. We have to be back at my office by 9:30,” her grandma said, pulling the covers off.

Her grandma already had a pair of jeans and a t-shirt waiting for her on the bed.

“Mom still sleeping?” Paxine said, dressing.

“Yes. Your dad stayed in town, dealing with all the security issues,” her grandma said.

Paxine picked up a yawning Tache, following her grandma to her cube.

“I’ll make tea at the office,” her grandma said.

“I’m still full from dinner. Garon’s dinner,” she said, thinking that a cup of tea was in order.

“Greta not here?” Paxine said when the cube door opened.

“No,” her grandma said, heading toward her office.

“Where’s Tinder?” Paxine said, noting that Tinder was nowhere in sight.

Her grandma pointed to one of the sofas, where Tinder slept. Her front leg bandaged, looked big and white.

“Vet said she’ll recover. Luckily she only got a small bit, but even so, it’s very painful,” her grandma said with a shiver.

Paxine put Tache by Tinder where he curled up next to her.

“I want you to sit in the corner. Listen, no talking,” her grandma said.

The door to the office opened.

“Greta. You startled me. I didn’t expect to see you today,” her grandma said.

“I receive notices when the alarms are turned off, and I expected you would be here for debriefings, with your assistant,” Greta said, giving Paxine a smile and a wink. “Besides, your phone is ringing off the hook, and I have a breeder on the phone. She has a litter. Would you like tea?”

“Send the trainer to check the litter, and yes, tea would be wonderful,” her grandma said looking grateful.

Paxine yawned as Greta left.

“Sit. Remember, listen. No talking. No matter what. You are to pretend you are invisible in that chair,” her grandma said to her.

Paxine didn’t see why, picking up a pen and paper, for something to do, otherwise, she felt she would fall asleep.

Her grandma sat at her desk, rummaging through papers.

Greta danced in, balancing a tea tray. There were four cups, and a dozen assorted cookies. She set the tea tray down on the coffee table, pausing a moment to look at the painting of the spotted cat.

“Beautiful, isn’t it?” her grandma said.

“I’ve grown to appreciate it more and more,” Greta said, revealing a folder in her hand. She gave it to Paxine’s grandma when she passed to leave. “I think you’ll like this.”

“Thanks. Mr. Cushing should be here soon. I see you have anticipated guests. You have the correct number of cups,” her grandma said.

“Good guess.” Greta smiled, “But I’m missing one thing. I will be right back.”

Her grandma opened the folder. “Here Paxine. Take a look and let me know what you see.”

In the folder was a single newspaper clipping. A picture showed the governor’s wife at a regional cat show. His wife raised and showed Abyssinians, and last fall one of her cats had reached Supreme Grand Champion.

“Our connection to the governor,” Paxine said.

“Exactly,” her grandma said, looking pleased.

Greta danced in with another tray and set it in front of Paxine. There was a glass with ice, her favorite soda, and chocolate chip cookies.

“Thanks, Greta,” Paxine said.

“Just, don’t tell your mother,” Greta said with a wink.

Paxine laughed. “Never.”

Tinder stretched on the sofa, flopping onto her other side.

“Yes, Tinder,” her grandma said in a quiet voice. “Things do work themselves out.”

Her grandma took the folder and clipping from Paxine, putting it in a desk drawer, then sat on the sofa, pouring tea.

The office door opened.

“Your guests,” Greta said.

“Good morning,” Paxine’s dad said with a nod.

Kirt followed behind. Both of them stopped, staring at Paxine.

“Good morning,” her grandma said. “Tea?”

Her dad nodded at Paxine before sitting opposite of her grandma. He now has his back to Paxine. Kirt followed, sitting next to her dad. Her dad poured himself tea and bit into a cookie.

Her dad and her grandma sipped tea. Kirt sat there doing nothing. Paxine sipped her soda, wondering why she was there.

The office door opened again and Garon entered. “Good morning. Oh, good, tea.” He sat next to her grandma and poured tea. He sipped the whole cup before checking Tinder’s bandage. “I’ll have to train her on Poppers.”

“I think she’s already learned,” her grandma said. “Well, how are Mr. and Mrs. Huntsboro this morning?”

“Not well,” her dad said. “Mr. Huntsboro is still in the hospital, under guard, and Mrs. Huntsboro is finding that prison garb does not match her shoes.”

“Excellent. We have also learned last night who might have been guiding Mr. Huntsboro and perhaps providing some of his funding,” her grandma said.

Paxine could see her dad stiffen, disguising it by sipping his tea. Kirt seemed frozen, staring down.

Garon chuckled. “Oh, yes, he wasn’t there for that. Paxine’s a good dancer.” He pretended to waltz in his seat before continuing. “I bugged, excuse the term, well, actually Shaloonya did…” Garon chuckled again. ”I thought I bugged Mr. Huntsboro’s tuxedo, only to find out it wasn’t his. I didn’t realize it was the governor’s retreat from the governor’s mansion.”

“Governor Talassee?” Kirt said, sitting upright.

“Mr. Huntsboro went there so often, but I guess he went there so often because he was getting his orders and money from there. No electronic transfer of funds. He was getting paid in cash,” Garon said.

“Governor Talassee?” Kirt said again as if to make sure they were talking about the correct man.

“There is only one governor,” her dad said with annoyance in his voice. “I told you we were fighting ourselves.”

Kirt nodded. “I think we need to re-evaluate our entire staff.”

“An honest man’s reply,” Garon said, taking a sip of tea

“Y-you suspected me?” Kirt said.

“No, but while neither of you report directly to the governor, some of your budget and most of your staff come from him,” Garon said. “That means whatever you do and know is a security leak.”

“We already know we had a security leak,” her dad said.

“We did? We do?” Kirt said, staring at him.

“Remember when I said I was worried about Paxine but I didn’t know if it was because of you or me?” her grandma said.

Her dad nodded. “I remember.”

“Looks like it was both of us. Mrs. Huntsboro was delusional to think she could take over my position, and Mr. Huntsboro was making quite a profit on supporting the Child Protection Act. He wasn’t happy with anyone who opposed it,” her grandma said.

Her dad looked at Kirt, but Kirt seemed struck dumb. “What do you have on Governor Talassee?” her dad said.

Paxine thought her dad should give Kirk a poke to wake him up.

“Depends,” Garon said, looking like a kid holding a sack of candy who couldn’t decide whether he wanted to share or not.

“I invited Garon here today to see if Kirt would be interested in learning a few things in regards to protection and surveillance as long as you don’t have Garon arrested. I would like my granddaughter better guarded should there be any future idiots delusional enough to challenge us,” she said, taking a sip of tea. “Also, Garon works for me. Information must be paid for.”

“Just what is your position?” Kirt said.

“I am a…”

“I don’t think we need to know,” her dad said, turning to nod at Paxine. He paused to examine the spotted cat painting.

“What are the cats for?” Kirt said.

“You need ask after last night?” her grandma said.

“Don’t ask,” her dad said, cutting him off from asking another question.

Greta poked her head in. “Sorry to interrupt, but the trainer wants to talk to you. It’s about the litter.”

“What about the litter?” her grandma said, showing no indication of rising from the sofa.

“One keeps climbing up to sit on her shoulder.”
